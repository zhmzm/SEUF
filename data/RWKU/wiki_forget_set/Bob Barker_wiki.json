The U.S. Indian Census Rolls, 1885\u20131940, list Barker as a citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, which the tribe publicly confirmed. His mother, Matilda (\"Tillie\") Valandra (n\u00e9e Matilda Kent Tarleton), was a schoolteacher; his father, Byron John Barker, was the foreman on the electrical high line through the state of Washington. As Barker's father was one-quarter Sioux, and his mother non-Native, Barker was one-eighth Sioux. Barker attended the grade school on the Rosebud Reservation where his mother was a teacher. He once said, \"I've always bragged about being part Indian, because they are a people to be proud of. And the Sioux were the greatest warriors of them all.\""}, {"text": "== Early life ==Barker met his future wife, Dorothy Jo Gideon, at an Ella Fitzgerald concert while he was attending high school in Missouri; they began dating when he was 15.

In 1950, he moved to California to advance his broadcasting career. He was given his own radio show, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for the next six years from Burbank. He was hosting an audience-participation radio show on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles when game show producer Ralph Edwards, who was looking for a new host to replace Jack Bailey on the daytime-television version of his long-running show, Truth or Consequences, happened to be listening and liked Barker's voice and style."}, {"text": "==== Truth or Consequences (1956\u20131975) ====Barker started hosting Truth or Consequences on December 31, 1956, and continued with the program until 1975."}, {"text": "==== The Price Is Right (1972\u20132007) ====In early 1972, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman began shopping a modernized revival of The Price Is Right, with Dennis James as host. NBC bought the Syndicated Nighttime version of the Show first with James at the helm. CBS expressed interest in the series. Due to a contractual obligation and the fact that James was already viewed as the \"NBC\" Host, CBS wanted Bob Barker as the daytime host. After some initial resistance, Barker instead offered to host another upcoming CBS game show, Jack Barry's The Joker's Wild (which had difficulty finding a host and was scheduled to debut the same day as Price) to allow James to host Price, but CBS rejected this proposal.(In December 1974 James stepped in to Host the Daytime version of the Show for 1 week when Barker was ill. This made Dennis James the only person to Host the Daytime CBS version and Nightime NBC version at the same time.)"}, {"text": "==== The Price Is Right (1972\u20132007) ====On September 4, 1972, Barker began hosting the CBS revival of The Price Is Right."}, {"text": "==== The Price Is Right (1972\u20132007) ====On October 15, 1987, Barker did what other MCs almost never did then: he stopped using hair dye and let his hair go gray, its natural color by that time."}, {"text": "==== The Price Is Right (1972\u20132007) ====Barker announced on October 31, 2006, that he would retire from The Price Is Right in June 2007.

By mutual decision, Barker and Burnet were never married and lived in separate residences throughout their relationship. He had no children with either woman, stating that he had seen his friends who had poor relationships with their children and felt that he was too busy to properly raise a child; as of 2007, he stated that he had no regrets about his decision. From the late 2000s onward, Burnet described the relationship as a platonic friendship, even as Barker had become more interested in remarrying; she recalled a 2011 incident where Barker drafted a prenuptial agreement for her lawyer to review and revise as she felt fit, which she refused.

He threatened to not attend the 2009 Game Show Awards, where he was to receive a lifetime achievement award, because Betty White would be attending. Although he had previously worked with White, he was feuding with her over the treatment of an elephant at the Los Angeles Zoo. White instead did not attend and pre-recorded her comments that she was scheduled to make about another awardee, Mark Goodson.

American Humane responded by suing Barker for $10 million, citing libel, slander and invasion of privacy. American Humane claimed that there had been a two-year \"vendetta\" against them behind the accusations. In a series of public advertisements along with the lawsuit, American Humane responded to Barker's claims that his allegations were made based on insufficient and misleading information.

Barker countersued for slander, but Hallstrom prevailed, receiving a settlement in 2005."}, {"text": "=== Lawsuits ===In October 2007, Deborah Curling, a CBS employee assigned to The Price Is Right, filed a lawsuit against CBS, Bob Barker, and The Price Is Right producers, claiming that she was forced to quit her job after testifying against Barker in a wrongful-termination lawsuit brought by a previous show producer. Curling claimed that she was demoted to an \"intolerable work environment\" backstage, which caused her to leave the job. Curling, who is black, also alleged that the show's producers, including Barker, created a hostile work environment in which black employees and contestants were discriminated against.

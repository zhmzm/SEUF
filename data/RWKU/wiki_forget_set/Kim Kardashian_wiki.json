Along with Van Jones and Jared Kushner, she was instrumental in persuading President Trump to support the First Step Act, which enacted major reforms in the US prison system. Van Jones later stated that without Kardashian, the act would have never passed because it would not have received the president's support. It was later passed by a great majority in the US Senate."}, {"text": "=== Prison reform and clemency advocacy ===In 2019, Kardashian largely funded the 90 Days to Freedom campaign, an initiative to release nonviolent drug offenders from life sentences by attorneys Brittany K. Barnett and MiAngel Cody. The effort resulted in 17 persons being released under provisions of the First Step Act. Kardashian was widely credited for the success of the campaign in media headlines. Commentary on her involvement ranged from praise, to assertions that it was a public relations stunt, to accusations that she was taking the credit for work she did not do. In a Facebook post from May 7 of that year, Barnett commented on the divisive and underfunded nature of the \"criminal justice reform space\", adding, \"Kim linked arms with us to support us when foundations turned us down. We and our clients and their families have a lot of love for her and are deeply grateful for her.\"In April 2022, Kardashian advocated for the clemency of Melissa Lucio, the only woman of Hispanic descent on Texas' death row, in a series of tweets. She tweeted, \"I recently just read about the case of Melissa Lucio and wanted to share her story with you. She has been on death row for over 14 years for her daughter's death that was a tragic accident.\" Lucio is on death row for the abuse and death of her daughter, who was two years old. Kardashian deleted the series of tweets the same day. When Lucio was granted a stay of execution on April 25, Kardashian celebrated on her social media channels.In July 2022, Kardashian expressed support and petitioned for the release of rapper Gunna, who was imprisoned without bond, charged with one count of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. However, in October of the same year, Gunna was again denied release from jail ahead of his January trial. In December, Gunna pled guilty to a single charge of racketeering and was sentenced to five years in prison, with one year commuted to time served and the rest of the sentence suspended subject to probation conditions. He was soon released from jail, and instead was ordered to serve 500 hours of community service."}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Kim Kardashian, Superstar (2007)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007\u20132021)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Disaster Movie (2008)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Kourtney and Kim Take Miami (2009\u20132013)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Kourtney and Kim Take New York (2011\u20132012)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor (2013)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Dash Dolls (2015)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==PAW Patrol: The Movie (2021)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==The Kardashians (2022\u2013present)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==American Horror Story: Delicate (2023)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie (2023)"}, {"text": "== Awards and nominations ==Teen Choice Awards"}, {"text": "== Awards and nominations ==Other awards"}, {"text": "== Bibliography ==Kardashian, Kim; Kardashian, Kourtney; Kardashian, Khlo\u00e9 (2010).

Right away, in March 1972, he landed his first piece of paid work as an actor: playing a plastic credit card inside a woman's purse in a Chargex television commercial. He was then cast by Stephen Schwartz for the new 1972 production of the Broadway hit Godspell being prepared at Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre. Among other members of that production's cast were Victor Garber, Gilda Radner, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, Andrea Martin, Jayne Eastwood, and Gerry Salsberg; Paul Shaffer was the musical director. As stated by Short in his 2014 memoir as well as in the 2018 documentary Love, Gilda, he and Gilda Radner dated each other on and off during that time.Short subsequently found work in several Canadian television shows and theatrical productions. These included being cast for the role of a tough, sexually predatory prison inmate in the 1972 staging of John Herbert's drama Fortune and Men's Eyes that had the upstart twenty-two-year-old actor commuting back to his hometown Hamilton, Ontario. With the success of Godspell at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in downtown Toronto, by late 1972, the production moved uptown to the Bayview Playhouse where it ran for 488 performances.

Short, on the other hand, resisted auditioning due to feeling a \"phobia of being funny on demand\" and considering himself a \"traditional song-and-dance performer\".In 1974, Short was hired as a writer on Everything Goes, a nightly variety show hosted by Norm Crosby, Mike Darow, and Catherine McKinnon.

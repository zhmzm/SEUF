He offered insight into his trading technique suggesting that traders know why they are buying something and to \"HODL\"(hold on for dear life) until they learn that something has changed.

Cuban was apparently incensed that Smith had thrown an elbow that barely missed Mavericks forward Antoine Wright. Cuban offered to match the fine with a donation to a charity of Smith's choosing. Cuban stated that if he doesn't hear from Smith, then he will donate the money to the NHL Players' Association Goals and Dreams Fund in the names of Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore. In May 2009, Cuban made a reference to the Denver Nuggets being \"thugs\" after a loss to the Nuggets in game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals. The statement was geared towards the Nuggets and their fans. As he passed Kenyon Martin's mother, who was seated near Cuban as he left the arena, he pointed at her and said, \"that includes your son.\" This controversial comment revisited media attention on Cuban yet again. Cuban issued an apology the next day referencing the poor treatment of away fans in arenas around the league. The league issued a statement stating that they would not fine him."}, {"text": "=== NBA fines ===On May 22, 2010, Cuban was fined $100,000 for comments he made during a television interview about trying to sign LeBron James."}, {"text": "=== NBA fines ===Despite his history, he was notably silent during the Mavericks' 2011 championship playoff run."}, {"text": "=== NBA fines ===Despite Cuban's history with David Stern, he believed the NBA Commissioner would leave a lasting legacy \"of a focus on growth and recognizing that the NBA is in the entertainment business and that it's a global product, not just a local product.

A stock dilution occurred shortly after a trade in June 2004, giving hints of inside knowledge at the time of the trade, and Cuban allegedly was saved from a loss of $750,000. The SEC claimed that Cuban ordered the sale of his holdings in Mamma.com after he had been confidentially approached by the company to participate in a transaction likely to dilute shares of current shareholders. Cuban disputed the charges, saying he had not agreed to keep the information secret. On his blog, Cuban contended the allegations were false and that the investigation was \"a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion\".

She submitted seven photographs, two of which Portland Police Detective Brendan McGuire referred to as \"significant\".  Cuban denied the allegations, and his attorney provided the results of a polygraph test taken by Cuban and written statements from two medical doctors stating that the actions described were anatomically improbable.  The Portland District Attorney's office declined to prosecute, citing a lack of concrete evidence to support the claim and the woman's preference not to proceed with charges, and concluding that \"no crime can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\".

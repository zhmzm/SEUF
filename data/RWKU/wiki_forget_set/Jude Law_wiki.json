He later gained prominence for his role in the Oscar Wilde biopic Wilde (1997), for which he won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer as well as a London Film Critics Circle Award for his portrayal of Lord Alfred Douglas, the glamorous young lover of Stephen Fry's Wilde. The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin noted that Law's \"voluptuous beauty and mocking, boyish petulance gives [Douglas] a rock star's presence.\" Other reviewers including William Gallagher also complimented Law's appearance as the character.

He originally auditioned for the role of Steve Sanders but lost to Ian Ziering.

He's mine,\" but did not reprise his role in the spin-off. He stated: \"When you're in the professional acting business, you have to look into all these offers, and I don't mean anything bad about it but creatively it's something I have done before and I don't know how it will benefit me if I do it again.\" Perry said that the fact that the show's longtime producer Aaron Spelling was not involved in the revival was critical: \"The difference between CW bringing something back and Aaron Spelling doing something is significant.

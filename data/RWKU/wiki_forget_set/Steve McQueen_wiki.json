McQueen's first film role under Elkins' management was a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films The Blob (his first leading role), Never Love a Stranger, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959)."}, {"text": "=== 1950s ===McQueen's first breakout role came on television.

He appeared as Randall in that episode, cast opposite series lead Robert Culp, a former New York motorcycle racing buddy.

The Magnificent Seven (1960), in which he played Vin Tanner and starred with Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Robert Vaughn, Charles Bronson, Horst Buchholz and James Coburn, became McQueen's first major hit and led to his withdrawal from Wanted: Dead or Alive. McQueen's focused portrayal of the taciturn second lead catapulted his career. His added touches in many of the shots (such as twirling a shotgun around before loading it, repeatedly checking his gun while in the background of a shot, and wiping his hat rim) annoyed top-billed Brynner, who protested that McQueen was stealing scenes. (In his autobiography, Eli Wallach reports struggling to conceal his amusement while watching the filming of the funeral procession scene in which Brynner's and McQueen's characters first meet.

Insurance concerns prevented McQueen from performing the film's notable motorcycle leap, which was done by his friend and fellow cycle enthusiast Bud Ekins, who resembled McQueen from a distance.

Nevada Smith was an enormously successful Western action adventure prequel that also featured Karl Malden and Suzanne Pleshette. After starring in 1965's The Cincinnati Kid as a poker player, McQueen earned his only Academy Award nomination in 1966 for his role as an engine room sailor in The Sand Pebbles, in which he starred opposite Candice Bergen and Richard Attenborough, with whom he had previously worked in The Great Escape."}, {"text": "=== 1960s ===He followed his Oscar nomination with 1968's Bullitt \u2013 one of his best-known films, and his personal favorite \u2013 which co-starred Jacqueline Bisset, Robert Vaughn and Don Gordon. It featured an unprecedented (and endlessly imitated) car chase through San Francisco. Although McQueen did the driving that appeared in closeups, his was about 10% of what is seen in the film's car chase. The rest of the driving by McQueen's character was done by stunt drivers Bud Ekins and Loren Janes. McQueen's character drove a 1968 Ford Mustang GT 390, while the antagonist's black Dodge Charger was driven by veteran stunt driver Bill Hickman. McQueen, his stunt drivers and Hickman spent several days before the scene was shot practicing high-speed, close-quarters driving.

McQueen played a fire chief assigned to stop a fire in a skyscraper. He was originally asked to play the architect who is the other hero of the story, but he requested to play the fire chief, thinking the part was \"showier\". The role of the architect went to Newman, a part that had more lines, hence McQueen requested more dialogue to even it out.

Barbara Minty, in her book Steve McQueen: The Last Mile, wrote of McQueen becoming an Evangelical Christian toward the end of his life. This was due in part to the influences of his flying instructor, Sammy Mason, Mason's son Pete, and Barbara herself. McQueen attended his local church, Ventura Missionary Church, and was visited by evangelist Billy Graham shortly before his death."}, {"text": "=== Lifestyle ===McQueen followed a daily two-hour exercise regimen involving weightlifting and, at one point, running 5 miles (8 km), seven days a week. McQueen learned the martial art Tang Soo Do from ninth-degree black belt Pat E. Johnson."}, {"text": "=== Lifestyle ===According to photographer William Claxton, McQueen smoked marijuana almost every day. Biographer Marc Eliot stated that McQueen used a large amount of cocaine in the early 1970s. He was also a heavy cigarette smoker. McQueen sometimes drank to excess; he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1972."}, {"text": "=== Manson connection ===Two months after Charles Manson incited the murder of five people, including McQueen's friends Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring, the media reported police had found a hit list with McQueen's name on it. According to his first wife, McQueen began carrying a handgun at all times in public, including at Sebring's funeral."}, {"text": "=== Charitable causes ===McQueen had an unusual reputation for demanding free items in bulk from studios when agreeing to do a film, such as electric razors, jeans and other items.

McQueen made occasional visits to the school to spend time with the students, often to play pool and speak about his experiences."}, {"text": "=== Political views ===McQueen supported Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election despite being registered as a Republican. He supported Richard Nixon in the 1968 United States presidential election."}, {"text": "== Illness and death ==McQueen developed a persistent cough in early 1978. He gave up cigarettes and underwent antibiotic treatments without improvement. His shortness of breath grew more pronounced and on December 22, 1979, after filming The Hunter, a biopsy revealed pleural mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure for which there is no known cure."}, {"text": "== Illness and death ==A few months later, McQueen gave a medical interview in which he blamed his condition on asbestos exposure. McQueen believed that asbestos used in movie sound stage insulation and race-drivers protective suits and helmets could have been involved, but he thought it more likely that his illness was a direct result of massive exposure while removing asbestos lagging (insulation) from pipes aboard a troop ship while he served in the Marines."}, {"text": "== Illness and death ==By February 1980, evidence of widespread metastasis was found. He tried to keep the condition a secret, but on March 11, 1980, the National Enquirer disclosed that he had \"terminal cancer\". In July 1980, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico, for unconventional treatment after U.S. doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over the trip because McQueen sought treatment from William Donald Kelley, who was promoting a variation of the Gerson therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cattle and sheep, massages, and laetrile, a reputed anti-cancer drug available in Mexico, but long known to be both toxic and ineffective at treating cancer. McQueen paid for Kelley's treatments himself in cash payments, which were said to have been upwards of $40,000 per month (equivalent to $148,000 in 2023) during his three-month stay in Mexico. Kelley's only medically related license (until being revoked in 1976) had been for orthodontics, a field of dentistry. Kelley's methods caused a sensation in the traditional and tabloid press when it became known that McQueen was a patient."}, {"text": "== Illness and death ==McQueen returned to the U.S. in early October. Despite metastasis of the cancer throughout McQueen's body, Kelley publicly announced that McQueen would be completely cured and could return to normal life. McQueen's condition soon worsened, and huge tumors developed in his abdomen."}, {"text": "== Illness and death ==In late October 1980, McQueen flew to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, Mexico, to have an abdominal tumor on his liver (weighing around 5 lbs) removed, despite warnings from his U.S. doctors that the tumor was inoperable and his heart could not withstand the surgery.:\u200a212\u201313\u200a Using the name \"Samuel Sheppard\", McQueen checked into a small Ju\u00e1rez clinic where the doctors and staff were unaware of his actual identity. On November 7, 1980, McQueen died of a heart attack at 3:45 a.m. at a Ju\u00e1rez hospital, 12 hours after surgery to remove or reduce numerous metastatic tumors in his neck and abdomen. He was 50 years old.

There was an encore presentation on October 10, 2017. The film received mostly positive reviews. Kenneth R. Morefield of Christianity Today said it \"offers a timeless reminder that even those among us living the most celebrated lives often long for the peace and sense of purpose that only God can provide\". Michael Foust of Wordslingers called it \"one of the most powerful and inspiring documentaries I've ever seen\"."}, {"text": "== Legacy ==In the 2019 Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, McQueen is portrayed by Damian Lewis.

The archive has preserved several of McQueen's home movies."}, {"text": "=== Ford commercials ===In 1998, director Paul Street created a commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from Bullitt. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic fastback Mustang used in Bullitt, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, similar to that used in The Great Escape."}, {"text": "=== Ford commercials ===In 2005, Ford used his likeness again, in a commercial for the 2005 Mustang. In the commercial, a farmer builds a winding racetrack, which he circles in the 2005 Mustang. Out of the cornfield comes McQueen. The farmer tosses his keys to McQueen, who drives off in the new Mustang. McQueen's likeness was created using a body double (Dan Holsten) and digital editing. Ford secured the rights to McQueen's likeness from the actor's estate licensing agent for an undisclosed sum."}, {"text": "=== Ford commercials ===At the Detroit Auto Show in January 2018, Ford unveiled the new 2019 Mustang Bullitt. The company called on McQueen's granddaughter, actress Molly McQueen, to make the announcement. After a brief rundown of the tribute car's particulars, a short film was shown in which Molly was introduced to the actual Bullitt Mustang, a 1968 Mustang Fastback with a 390 cubic-inch engine and a four-speed manual gearbox. That car has been in possession of the same family since 1974 and hidden away from the public until then, when it was driven out from under the press stand and up the center aisle of Ford's booth to much fanfare."}, {"text": "==== Motorcycles and cars ====One of his motorcycles, a 1937 Crocker, sold for a world-record price of $276,500 at the same auction.

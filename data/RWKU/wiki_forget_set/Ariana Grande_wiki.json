Trap-pop was more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener and Thank U, Next. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone opined that Grande \"set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming\" and \"embrace[d] the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop\" on Sweetener, exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity. Craig Jenkins of Vulture noted that she embraced trap and hip hop with undertones of R&B on Thank U, Next, with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love. Her sixth album, Positions, further emphasized the R&B and trap-pop sound of its two predecessors, with lyrics discussing sex and romance."}, {"text": "=== Influences ===Grande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music.

Grande and Gomez agreed on a divorce settlement in October 2023, which was finalized in March 2024. Because the couple had a prenuptial agreement, no children, and no significant legal disputes in their split, their divorce moved quickly and cleanly in the court system and only had to wait the required six months before a judge's order could take effect. Under their settlement, Grande was ordered to make a one-time payment of $1.25 million to Gomez with no future alimony, give him half of the proceeds of the sale of their Los Angeles home, and pay up to $25,000 towards his attorney's fees."}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Don't Look Up (2021)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Wicked (2024)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Wicked Part Two (2025)"}, {"text": "== Discography ==Studio albums"}, {"text": "== Discography ==Yours Truly (2013)"}, {"text": "== Discography ==My Everything (2014)"}, {"text": "== Discography ==Dangerous Woman (2016)"}, {"text": "== Discography ==Sweetener (2018)"}, {"text": "== Discography ==Thank U, Next (2019)"}, {"text": "== Discography ==Positions (2020)"}, {"text": "== Discography ==Eternal Sunshine (2024)"}, {"text": "==== Headlining ====The Listening Sessions (2013)"}, {"text": "==== Headlining ====The Honeymoon Tour (2015)"}, {"text": "==== Headlining ====Dangerous Woman Tour (2017)"}, {"text": "==== Headlining ====Sweetener World Tour (2019)"}, {"text": "==== Promotional ====The Sweetener Sessions (2018)"}, {"text": "==== Opening act ====Justin Bieber \u2013 Believe Tour (2013)"}, {"text": "== See also ==List of American Grammy Award winners and nominees"}, {"text": "== See also ==List of artists who have achieved simultaneous UK and US number-one hits"}, {"text": "== See also ==List of artists who reached number one in the United States"}, {"text": "== See also ==List of Billboard Social 50 number-one artists"}, {"text": "== See also ==List of highest-certified music artists in the United States"}, {"text": "== See also ==Honorific nicknames in popular music"}, {"text": "== See also ==UK Singles Chart records and statistics"}, {"text": "== See also ==List of most-streamed songs on Spotify"}, {"text": "== External links ==Official website "}, {"text": "== External links ==Ariana Grande at IMDb"}, {"text": "== External links ==Ariana Grande at the Internet Broadway Database"}]

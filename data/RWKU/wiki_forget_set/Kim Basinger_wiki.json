She soon reconsidered and went to New York to become a Ford model. Despite earning US$1,000 a day, Basinger never enjoyed modeling, saying: \"It was very hard to go from one booking to another and always have to deal with the way I looked. I couldn't stand it. I felt myself choking.\" Basinger has said that even as a model, when others relished looking in the mirror before appearing, she abhorred it and would avoid mirrors out of insecurity. Not long after her Ford deal, Basinger appeared on the cover of magazines. She also appears on the cover of the debut album by the band Survivor. She appeared in hundreds of advertisements throughout the early 1970s, most notably as the Breck Shampoo girl. She alternated between modeling and attending acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse, as well as performing in Greenwich Village clubs as a singer. Basinger is an alumna of the William Esper Studio for the performing arts in Manhattan, New York City."}, {"text": "=== Early roles (1976\u20131982) ===In 1976, after four years as a cover girl, Basinger quit modeling and moved to Los Angeles to act. She made guest appearances on a few television shows such as McMillan & Wife and Charlie's Angels, turning down a regular role in the latter series that eventually went to Cheryl Ladd. Her first starring role was a made-for-TV movie, Katie: Portrait of a Centerfold (1978), in which she played a small town girl who goes to Hollywood to become an actress and winds up becoming a famous centerfold for a men's magazine. In 1979, she co-starred with Natalie Wood, William Devane and Steve Railsback in the miniseries remake of From Here to Eternity, reprising her role as prostitute Lorene Rogers in a 13-episode spinoff that aired in 1980.

In his review of the film, Gary Arnold of The Washington Post said Basinger \"looks like a voluptuous sibling of Liv Ullmann and has a certain something.\" Worldwide, Never Say Never Again grossed US$160 million. Basinger said her subsequent Playboy appearance led to further opportunities, such as the role of the romantic interest of a baseball team star in Barry Levinson's The Natural (1984), alongside Robert Redford, for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress."}, {"text": "=== Worldwide exposure (1983\u20131989) ===Blake Edwards cast her twice in his films; as a beautiful woman married to a Texas millionaire in The Man Who Loved Women (1983), and as an apparently shy woman who goes on a date with a workaholic man in Blind Date (1987). Robert Altman cast Basinger in the role of a woman hiding from her former lover at an old motel in Fool for Love (1985). In 1986, Basinger starred as a New York City art gallery employee who has a brief yet intense affair with a mysterious Wall Street broker, opposite Mickey Rourke, in Adrian Lyne's controversial erotic romantic drama 9\u00bd Weeks. Though the film failed at the North American box office, it performed very well in Europe, especially France, and acquired a large American fanbase on home video and cable. Roger Ebert praised the film, comparing it to Last Tango in Paris, and said Basinger helped \"develop an erotic tension [...] that is convincing, complicated and sensual.\""}, {"text": "=== Worldwide exposure (1983\u20131989) ===Academy Award-winning writer-director Robert Benton also cast her in the title role of a slightly pregnant woman in trouble for Nadine (1987). While most of the films Basinger starred in during this period were released to varying degrees of success, they helped to establish her as an actress. With over US$400 million in box office totals, the highest-grossing film of her career thus far is Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, in which Basinger took on role of photojournalist Vicki Vale, opposite Michael Keaton (Batman) and Jack Nicholson (Joker). Basinger re-wrote the film's third act with producer Jon Peters with whom she was having a behind the scenes affair. The Hollywood Reporter, in its original review, remarked that \"the uniqueness and very soul of the film [...] is achieved through the beautifully defined and probing performances of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale\"."}, {"text": "=== 1990s ===Following the success of Batman, Basinger played a glamorous singer, alongside Alec Baldwin, in the comedy The Marrying Man (1991), and starred with Richard Gere, as a woman romantically involved with her sister's psychiatrist, in the neo-noir Final Analysis (1992). Both films were released to moderate box office returns. In 1992, Basinger was also a guest vocalist on a re-recorded version of Was (Not Was)'s \"Shake Your Head\", which featured Ozzy Osbourne on vocals, and reached the UK Top 5, and starred in what marked her only voice-acting project to date, the film Cool World, directed by Ralph Bakshi, as a cartoon bombshell who longs to become a real human woman."}, {"text": "=== 1990s ===In 1993, Basinger took on the roles of a woman recently released from prison in the crime film The Real McCoy, and that of a woman named Honey Horn\u00e9e in the comedy Wayne's World 2. In 1994, she reunited professionally with Baldwin for the thriller The Getaway, in which she portrayed the wife of a former con, and with director Robert Altman for the comedy Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter, playing a breathlessly dim-witted cable reporter.

Confidential (1997), alongside Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. She initially turned down the film twice, feeling an insecurity at returning to the screen and enjoying motherhood. The Washington Post felt that Basinger \"exudes a sort of chaste sultriness\", in what Roger Ebert described as \"one of the best films of the year\". The role earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, and was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

Confidential and her next film, I Dreamed of Africa (2000), were the most pleasurable of her career."}, {"text": "=== 2000s ===In I Dreamed of Africa, Basinger portrayed writer and environmentalist Kuki Gallmann, with Vincent P\u00e9rez, whom she called the \"most incredible actor she had ever worked with\". The film was described as a \"passion project\" for her, and she told UrbanCinefile that she \"cried for hours\" when she had to leave Kenya, where filming took place. Budgeted at US$50 million, I Dreamed of Africa got a 10 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and only managed to pull in US$14 million at the worldwide box office."}, {"text": "=== 2000s ===Curtis Hanson cast her again, this time as the alcoholic mother of an aspiring rapper, in 8 Mile (2002), opposite Eminem and Brittany Murphy. The film appeared on many top ten lists of the year, and in his review, Roger Ebert asserted: \"There has been criticism of Kim Basinger, who is said to be too attractive and even glamorous to play [Eminem]'s mother, but [...] Her performance finds the right note somewhere between love and exasperation; it cannot be easy to live with this sullen malcontent, whose face lights up only when he sees his baby sister\". 8 Mile was a commercial success, grossing $242.9 million worldwide."}, {"text": "=== 2000s ===Basinger starred as the wife of a children's book author, with Jeff Bridges and Jon Foster, in The Door in the Floor (2004), a drama with heavy sexual themes adapted from the novel A Widow for One Year by John Irving.

While the film found a limited release in theaters, The Telegraph, in its review, wrote: \"Arriaga pulls together the strands of his narrative with great expertise [and] his job is made easier by great performances from three actresses: Theron and Basinger, who both look like racing certs for next year's awards season, and Jennifer Lawrence as Basinger's teenage daughter\"."}, {"text": "=== 2000s ===In 2008, Basinger produced and starred in the independent thriller While She Was Out, as a suburban housewife who is forced to fend for herself when she becomes stranded in a desolate forest with four murderous thugs.

In it, Basinger starred as the chronically depressed wife of a jaded film executive (played by Billy Bob Thornton)."}, {"text": "=== 2010s ===Basinger played the mother of a young man who made a promise to his deceased brother, with Zac Efron, in the supernatural drama Charlie St. Cloud (2010), based on the 2004 best-selling novel The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud by Ben Sherwood."}, {"text": "=== 2010s ===Basinger returned to Africa in her next film, the 2012 Nigerian drama Black November, about a Niger Delta community's struggle to save their environment, which was being destroyed by excessive oil drilling. As part of an ensemble cast (which included her 9\u00bd Weeks co-star Mickey Rourke), she played the role of a kidnapped reporter. While the film had a significant impact upon its release, The Hollywood Reporter noted: \"Don't be fooled by the names of Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger on the marquee. Despite the tantalizing prospect of a reunion of the stars of a certain '80s-era hit erotic drama, their minor presence is largely extraneous to the proceedings of [this] overwrought and preachy thriller\"."}, {"text": "=== 2010s ===Basinger played the role of wife in two 2013 films \u2014 the independent drama Third Person, with Liam Neeson and Olivia Wilde, and the sports comedy Grudge Match, with Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone.

Basinger developed agoraphobia that same year, following a panic attack in a health-food store, and was housebound for six months.

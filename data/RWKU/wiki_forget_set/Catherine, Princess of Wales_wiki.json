Her parents, Michael Middleton and Carole (n\u00e9e Goldsmith), were a flight dispatcher and flight attendant at British Airways, respectively; she is the eldest of their three children. In 1987, her mother founded Party Pieces, a privately held mail order company that sold party supplies and decorations. Following her mother's retirement and the buyout of her majority shareholding, the new business management at that stage encountered difficulties after axing the quarterly product catalogue. Party Pieces was subsequently rescued from administration in 2023 by millionaire entrepreneur James Sinclair.By the early 20th century, the Middleton family had married into British aristocracy and benefited financially from trust funds which they had established over a century ago. Her Middleton relatives, including her great-grandparents No\u00ebl and Olive Middleton, played host to members of the British royal family in the 1920s through to the 1940s.

Catherine was also named in the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in the same year."}, {"text": "== Public image and style ==In December 2022, she was found to be the second most liked member of the royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov, while an Ipsos favourability poll in April 2023 suggested that she was the most liked member. In 2023 and 2024, The Independent included Catherine on its \"Influence List\". In April 2024, she was found to be the most popular member of the royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov.Speaking to The Times on Catherine's 40th birthday, her aides stated that she does not accept \"advice on a PR basis\" and will \"never do something because she thinks the media will like it.\" Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, her and William's former private secretary, stated that \"she has that almost old-fashioned, Queen Mother attitude to drama \u2013 she just doesn't do it.\""}, {"text": "== Privacy and the media ==The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, while being chased by paparazzi in August 1997 has since influenced her elder son, William's, attitude towards the media. Catherine and William have often requested that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected.In April 2004, The Sun published pictures of William and Middleton at a ski resort and alleged that she was his girlfriend. After her graduation from university, Middleton was faced with widespread press attention and was often photographed by the paparazzi. In October 2005, she complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity and complained that photographers were permanently stationed outside her flat. Former royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter stated that her treatment by the press drew parallels to the tumultuous experience of Diana in the early years of her marriage. Between 2005 and 2006, Middleton's phone was hacked 155 times according to former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, who was involved in a phone hacking scandal by the newspaper that targeted the royal family In 2005, after Middleton was chased by the paparazzi on her way to an interview, William consulted her and her father and penned a legal letter to newspapers requesting that they respect her privacy. In April 2006, her lawyers issued new warnings to the Daily Mail, the Daily Star and The Sun and the picture agencies Big Pictures and Matrix after they published photographs of Middleton on a bus during a shopping trip.Media attention increased around the time of Middleton's 25th birthday in January 2007, where twenty photographers and five television crews photographed her leaving for work. Warnings were issued by Prince Charles, Prince William, and Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi pictures of Middleton, but continued to use photographs of her at public events. In March 2007, her lawyers filed a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) over a photograph published on the Daily Mirror that was taken as a result of harassment. In April 2007, Middleton reached a settlement with the Daily Mirror, which was followed by a warning by the PCC over her treatment by the press. In July 2007, MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee stated in a report on press regulation that Middleton was the victim of \"clear and persistent harassment\" by the paparazzi and criticised the lack of intervention by the PCC, who circulated a letter from her solicitors on the issue of press harassment but said they were not directly asked by her lawyers to act.In 2010 Middleton pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her playing tennis over Christmas 2009 while on holiday in Cornwall. She was awarded \u00a35,000 damages, legal costs, and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd and announced that the money would be donated to charity. In 2011 close associates of Jonathan Rees, a private investigator connected to the News International phone hacking scandal, stated that he had targeted Catherine during her period as William's girlfriend.In May 2011, the Middleton family complained to the PCC after photographs of Catherine, her sister, and their mother in bikinis while on holiday in 2006 on board a yacht off Ibiza were published in the Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail, News of the World, and Daily Mirror. One of the photographs showed Catherine's sister topless, which prompted the family to complain about newspapers breaching the editors' code of practice by invading their privacy. In September 2011, Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday, and Daily Mirror all agreed to have the images removed from their website and never publish them again following a deal negotiated by the PCC.In September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi published photographs of Catherine sunbathing topless while on holiday at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet (a private ch\u00e2teau on a 260-hectare estate 71 km north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool\u2014a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens. On 17 September 2012, William and Catherine filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre. The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer, prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated. Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to \u20ac45,000 for individuals and \u20ac225,000 for companies. In September 2017, Closer was fined \u20ac100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined \u20ac45,000.In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital where Catherine was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on Catherine's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide. The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions."}, {"text": "== Privacy and the media ==In February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed pregnant belly, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots. While Catherine was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the United Kingdom published the picture. In October 2014, Catherine and William sent a legal letter to a freelance photographer who had put their son George and his nanny \"under surveillance\", asking the individual to stop \"harassing and following\" them. On 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the \"dangerous\" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.In March 2019, the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Catherine and her sister-in-law Meghan. In May 2020, Kensington Palace said that the cover story of Tatler magazine titled \"Catherine the Great\" contained \"a swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations\". Despite the palace's statement that most of the material was not given to them before publication, the magazine's editor-in-chief announced that he would stand behind the story as the palace had been aware of it for months. In September 2020, after pressure from the couple's lawyers, the magazine removed remarks on Catherine's family and other similar claims from the online version of the story. In March 2024, the London Clinic initiated an investigation into a potential breach of privacy law after up to three staff members were found attempting to access Catherine's private medical records following her discharge from the hospital."}, {"text": "=== Photograph controversy ===In early March 2024, the Associated Press, AFP, Reuters and Getty Images withdrew from publishing a Mother's Day photograph of Catherine and her children. The photograph was attributed to William and accompanied by a personal message from her. The Associated Press explained it retracted the photograph because of concerns regarding digital alteration of the image at its source. AFP and Reuters raised similar concerns. The following day, in a message posted by Kensington Palace, Catherine apologised for any confusion created and said she had personally edited the family photograph that was shared publicly. The incident occurred after she had begun chemotherapy treatment for cancer which she announced on 22 March that year."}, {"text": "=== Titles and styles ===Upon her marriage in April 2011, Catherine automatically became a princess of the United Kingdom, gained the style Royal Highness and the titles Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn, and Baroness Carrickfergus. She was normally known as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge\" except in Scotland, where she was instead called \"Her Royal Highness The Countess of Strathearn\".On her father-in-law's accession on 8 September 2022, Catherine also became Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Rothesay. Thus, she was briefly referred to by the title \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge\". On 9 September 2022, the King announced William's appointment as Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, thereby making Catherine Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester. She has since been known as \"Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales\", and as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Rothesay\" in Scotland."}, {"text": "=== Honours ===Catherine is a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, and a recipient of the Royal Family Order of Queen Elizabeth II."}, {"text": "== Ancestry ==Catherine's father Michael Francis Middleton is the son of Captain Peter Francis Middleton, who, along with their Middleton forebears, were from Leeds, West Yorkshire. Historian Robert Lacey describes Michael Middleton's family as having aristocratic ties, with Florence, Baroness Airedale being his distant relative. Both Catherine's paternal great-grandmother Olive Christiana Middleton (n\u00e9e Lupton) and her first-cousin-once-removed Baroness von Schunck (n\u00e9e Kate Lupton) grew up at  Potternewton Hall Estate, the seat of the Lupton family, who are described as landed gentry and, as such, were invited to the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Four successive generations of Catherine's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate: Catherine's great-grandmother Olive Middleton; her father, politician Francis Martineau Lupton; his mother, educator Frances Elizabeth Lupton; and her father, epidemiologist and surgeon Thomas Michael Greenhow.Catherine's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham. Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet, who was a descendant of Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet. Other paternal ancestors include Sir Thomas Fairfax and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of Edward III."}, {"text": "=== Book contributions ===\"Foreword\", in: Bairsto, Alison; Black, Jill; Jeffers, Holly (2014).

He had smooth, soulful tones, but he was spiritual at the same time. In his autobiography, Kelly stated that he was heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye's R&B Lothario image. \"I had to make a 'baby-makin'' album. If Marvin Gaye did it, I wanted to do it\", Kelly said.While Kelly created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soulman crooning and funk, the most distinctive element of his music is its explicit sensuality. \"Sex Me\", \"Bump n' Grind\", \"Your Body's Callin'\", and \"Feelin' on Yo Booty\" are considered to be examples, as their productions were seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. Kelly's crossover appeal was also sustained by his development of a flair for pop balladry."}, {"text": "=== Vocal style and lyrical themes ===Writing for the New York Daily News in 1997, Nunyo Demasio stated \"With a voice that easily shifts from booming baritone to seductive alto, Kelly has gained international celebrity by combining streetwise rhythms with sexually explicit lyrics.\" Love and sex are the topics of the majority of Kelly's lyrical content, although he has written about a wide variety of themes such as inspiration and spirituality. Chicago Sun-Times reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon Pallasch observed about the contrasting themes: \"... the image he liked to project was that of the \"R&B Thug\"... bringing the streetwise persona of the gangsta rapper into the more polite world of R&B.\"Kelly expressed that he writes from everyday experiences and prides himself on being versatile. Larry Khan, senior vice president of Jive's urban marketing and promotion, said that Kelly's musical compass is second to none. DeRogatis and Pallasch reported that at concerts where Kelly would go from singing \"Like a Real Freak\" to \"I Wish\": \"Many fans found these abrupt shifts between the transcendent and the venal, the inspirational and the X-rated jarring.\""}, {"text": "=== Influence ===Kelly is considered to be one of the most successful R&B artists since the mid-1980s. He is also one of the bestselling music artists in the United States, with over 30 million albums sold, as well as only the fifth black artist to enter the top 50 of the same list. Rolling Stone magazine called him \"arguably the most important R&B figure of the 1990s and 2000s\". Music executive Barry Weiss described Kelly as \"the modern-day Prince, although there's a bit of Marvin Gaye in him, and a bit of Irving Berlin\". R. Kelly has also been compared to artists like Sam Cooke and Bobby Brown.In addition to his solo and collaboration success, Kelly has also written and produced several hit songs, such as \"Age Ain't Nothing but a Number\" for Aaliyah, \"Fortunate\" for Maxwell, \"You Are Not Alone\" for Michael Jackson, \"G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T.\" for Changing Faces, \"Bump, Bump, Bump\" for B2K, and many more."}, {"text": "== Honors and awards ==Kelly has received and been nominated for multiple awards, as a songwriter, producer, and singer.

Kelly has faced repeated accusations of sexual abuse for incidents dating from 1991 to 2018 and has been the subject of a long-term investigation by the Chicago Sun-Times since August 2000. He has been tried in multiple civil suits and criminal trials, starting in 1996 when Tiffany Hawkins alleged that, starting in 1991 when she was age 15, Kelly, aged 24, had sexual relations with her and encouraged her to entice underaged friends. Following leaked video recordings, Kelly was prosecuted on child pornography charges in 2002, leading to a controversial trial that ended with his acquittal in 2008 on all charges. The 2019 documentary Surviving R. Kelly reexamined Kelly's alleged sexual misconduct with minors, prompting RCA Records to terminate his contract and resulted in additional investigations by law enforcement beginning in 2019. This culminated in a 2021 conviction for violations of the Mann Act and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and a 2023 conviction for production of child pornography. Defenders of Kelly maintained that he was merely a \"playboy\" and a \"sex symbol.\" Judge Ann Donnelly, who presided over Kelly's 2021 trial, summarized Kelly's actions as having \"[used] his fame and organization to lure young people into abusive sexual relationships\u2014a racketeering enterprise that the government alleged spanned about 25 years.\" As of 2023, he is serving a 31-year combined sentence at FCI Butner Medium I."}, {"text": "=== Other court cases ===Other than the federal sex abuse cases, Kelly has been involved in several high-profile criminal cases and lawsuits."}, {"text": "==== Criminal ====August 13, 1997: Kelly was found guilty of battery and placed on unsupervised probation for one year in Lafayette, Louisiana as a result of a July 1996 brawl which involved the singer and his entourage.

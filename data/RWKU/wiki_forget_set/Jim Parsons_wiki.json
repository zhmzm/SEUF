He is the son of Milton Joseph \"Mickey/Jack\" Parsons Jr. and teacher Judy Ann (n\u00e9e McKnight). His sister, Julie Ann Parsons, is also a teacher.After playing the role of the Kola-Kola bird in a school production of The Elephant's Child at age six, Parsons was determined to become an actor. He attended Klein Oak High School in Spring. Parsons points to a role in Noises Off during his junior year as the first time \"I fully connected with the role I was playing and started to truly understand what it meant to be honest on stage.\" The young Parsons was heavily influenced by sitcoms, particularly Three's Company, Family Ties, and The Cosby Show.After graduating from high school, Parsons earned a BA degree in Theater from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in three years. He was a founding member of Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre. Parsons enrolled in graduate school at the University of San Diego in 1999. He was one of seven students accepted into a special two-year course in classical theater, taught in partnership with the Old Globe Theater. Program director Rick Seer recalled having reservations about admitting Parsons, saying, \"Jim is a very specific personality. He's thoroughly original, which is one reason he's been so successful. But we worried, 'Does that adapt itself to classical theater? Does that adapt itself to the kind of training that we're doing?' But we decided that he was so talented that we would give him a try and see how it worked out.\"Parsons enjoyed school and told an interviewer that he would have pursued a doctorate in acting if possible: \"School was so safe!.....You frequently would surprise yourself by what you were capable of, and you were not surprised by some things.\" Parsons graduated with a M.F.A. degree in acting from Old Globe Theatre/University of San Diego in 2001 and moved to New York. Parsons traced his family's history on TLC's Who Do You Think You Are? in September 2013, and discovered French heritage from his father's side.

Parsons also had minor roles in several movies, including Garden State and School for Scoundrels."}, {"text": "=== 2007\u20132019: The Big Bang Theory and theatre roles ===Parsons has estimated that he auditioned for between 15 and 30 television pilots, but on many of the occasions when he was cast, the show failed to find a television network willing to purchase it. The exception came with The Big Bang Theory. After reading the pilot script, Parsons felt that the role of Sheldon Cooper would be a very good fit for him. Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers \"brilliantly use those words that most of us don't recognize to create that rhythm, and the rhythm got me. It was the chance to dance through that dialogue and in a lot of ways still is.\" In his audition, Parsons impressed series creator Chuck Lorre that Lorre insisted on a second audition to see if Parsons could replicate the performance. Parsons was cast as Sheldon Cooper, a physicist with social apathy who frequently belittles his friends. The role required Parsons to \"rattle off line after line of tightly composed, rhythmic dialogue, as well as then do something with his face or body during the silence that follows.\" Parsons credits his University of San Diego training with giving him the tools to break down Sheldon's lines.Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons's physical comedy to that of Buster Keaton and other silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons' instincts, saying that \"You can't teach that.\" Lorre describes Parsons' \"great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks, holds his hands, cocks his head, the facial tics as 'inspired'.\" Reviewer Lewis Beale describes Parsons' performance as \"so spot-on, it seems as if the character and the actor are the same person.\" Parsons admits that the work is \"more effort than I ever thought a sitcom would take, and that's really the fun of it.\" In August 2009, Parsons won the Television Critics Association award for individual achievement in comedy, beating Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Steve Carell, and Neil Patrick Harris.

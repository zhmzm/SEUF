By 1991, Williams had a 46\u20133 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No.1 among under-10 players in Florida. When Williams was 10, Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments, as he wanted them to \"go slowly\" and focus on school, and because he wanted to ensure they would not burn out before turning professional. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Richard responded, \"Everyone does different things.

Many players, commentators, and sports writers regard Williams as the greatest female tennis player of all time. In 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest female tennis player in history. In 2018, Roger Federer said the player who probably has the best case for \"Greatest Of All Time\", man or woman, is Serena Williams.  In 2022, McEnroe described Williams as an \"icon\" and the \"GOAT of GOATs\". BBC presenter and former French Open Champion Sue Barker has called Williams's serve \"without question the greatest ever\"."}, {"text": "== Legacy ==Williams has won the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportswoman of the Year four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018). In December 2019, the Associated Press named her Female Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s. She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time."}, {"text": "== Legacy ==For their first match in March 2019, the members of the United States women's national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman who inspired them on the back. Crystal Dunn chose Serena Williams. In September 2022, Twitter said that Williams was the most tweeted-about female athlete of all time. She and Venus have been widely credited with increasing diversity within the sport."}, {"text": "=== Playing style ===Williams was an aggressive baseliner whose game was centered around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hit a large number of winners and a large number of unforced errors. Williams's serve\u2014which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis\u2014is known for its speed and accurate placement, which allowed her to deliver numerous aces. At the 2013 Australian Open, she delivered the third-fastest serve in WTA recorded history, a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace against Ayumi Morita. Williams possessed an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this made it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke. Williams also possessed effective and accurate kick and slice serves. She deployed these as second serves, minimizing double faults and preventing opponents from scoring free points."}, {"text": "=== Playing style ===Williams's forehand and backhand are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis. She hit both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes. She was able to generate sharp, acute angles, which allowed her to hit winners from any position on the court. Her forehand\u2014which has been described as \"devastating\"\u2014was hit with heavy topspin, which allowed her to dominate rallies. She was capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners. Her two-handed backhand was equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time. Williams tended to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, which allowed her to hit with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams was an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience. She frequently chose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash. She possessed an aggressive return of serve; she neutralized powerful first serves, and attacked weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest returners of all time."}, {"text": "=== Playing style ===Despite predominantly employing an aggressive style, Williams was also an excellent defender who was capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she created an opportunity to hit a winner. She was an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allowed her to execute her game plan effectively. American tennis player Christina McHale praised her composure in high-pressure moments, while Martina Navratilova called her mental strength \"unbelievable\". Williams has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly at the Grand Slam level. She won three Slams after saving match points, more than any other player in history. Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches. Her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described by McEnroe as \"a gift\", and he called her \"the greatest\" competitor in the history of women's tennis. She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired player Li Na in 2016, \"break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace\"."}, {"text": "=== Coaches ===Williams had five coaches during her career: Richard Williams (1994\u20132022), Oracene Price (1994\u20132003), Patrick Mouratoglou (2012\u20132022), Eric Hechtman (2022) and Rennae Stubbs (2022)."}, {"text": "=== Endorsements ===Williams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999, and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma.

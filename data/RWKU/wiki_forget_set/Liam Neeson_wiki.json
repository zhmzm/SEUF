He attended St Patrick's College, Ballymena, from 1963 to 1967, and later recalled that his love of drama began there.He said that growing up as a Catholic in a predominantly Protestant town made him cautious, and once said he felt like a \"second-class citizen\" there, but has also said he was never made to feel \"inferior or even different\" at the town's predominantly Protestant technical college. \"It would be colourful to imagine I had a rebellious, uproarious Irish background,\" he has said, \"but the facts were much greyer. Irish, yes. But all that nationalistic stuff, crying into your Guinness and singing rebel songs\u2014that was never my scene.\" He has described himself as \"out of touch\" with the politics and history of Northern Ireland until becoming aware of protests by fellow students after Bloody Sunday, a massacre in Derry in 1972 during the Troubles, which encouraged him to learn more local history. In a 2009 interview, he said, \"I never stop thinking about [the Troubles]. I've known guys and girls who have been perpetrators of violence and victims. Protestants and Catholics. It's part of my DNA.\"At age nine, Neeson began boxing lessons at the All Saints Youth Club, and went on to win a number of regional titles before quitting at 17.

He also said that he had purposely gone into \"black areas of the city\" but that he \"did seek help\" and counselling from his friends and a priest after coming to his senses. He said that the lesson of his experience was \"to open up [and] to talk about these things\", including toxic masculinity and the underlying \"racism and bigotry\" in both the U.S. and Northern Ireland.

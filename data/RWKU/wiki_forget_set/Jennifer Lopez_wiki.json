After serving in the army, David worked as a computer technician at Guardian Insurance Company. Guadalupe was a homemaker for the first ten years of L\u00f3pez's life and later worked as a Tupperware salesperson and a kindergarten and gym teacher. They divorced in the 1990s after 33 years of marriage."}, {"text": "== Early life ==Lopez is a middle child; she has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda. The three shared a bedroom. Lopez has described her upbringing as \"strict\". She was raised in a Roman Catholic family; she attended Mass every Sunday and received a Catholic education, attending Holy Family School and the all-girls Preston High School. In school, Lopez ran track on a national level, participated in gymnastics and was on the softball team. She danced in school musicals and played a lead role in a production of Godspell. She described herself as a \"tomboy\" and \"very athletic\"."}, {"text": "== Early life ==There was \"lots of music\" in the typically Puerto Rican household, and Lopez and her sisters were encouraged to sing, dance and create their own plays for family events. West Side Story made a particular impression on the young Lopez, who wanted to be an entertainer from an early age. As a teenager, she learned flamenco, jazz and ballet at the Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club and taught dance to younger students, including Kerry Washington. After graduating from high school, she had a part-time secretarial job at a law firm and studied business at New York's Baruch College for one semester. At age 18, she enrolled as a full-time student at Manhattan's Phil Black Dance Studio, where she had already taken night classes in jazz and tap dance. Her parents were unhappy with her decision to leave college to pursue a dance career. According to Lopez, her parents felt it was \"foolish\" because \"no Latinas did that\". Her mother asked her to move out of the family home and they stopped speaking for eight months. Lopez moved to Manhattan, sleeping in the dance studio's office for the first few months."}, {"text": "=== 1989\u20131996: Professional dancing and early acting roles ===Lopez's first professional job came in 1989 when she spent five months touring Europe with the musical revue show Golden Musicals of Broadway. She was upset at being the only member of the chorus not to have a solo, and later characterized it as a pivotal moment where she had to \"try harder and become that much more committed\". In 1990, she danced alongside MC Hammer in an episode of Yo! MTV Raps, and traveled around Japan for four months as a chorus member in Synchronicity. When she returned to the United States, she was hired as a backup dancer for New Kids on the Block's performance of \"Games\" at the 1991 American Music Awards. She also traveled around America with regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!. During this period, Lopez also danced in music videos including Doug E. Fresh's \"Summertime\", Richard Rogers' \"Can't Stop Loving You\", EPMD's \"Rampage\", and Samantha Fox's \"(Hurt Me! Hurt Me!) But the Pants Stay On\". Lopez stated: \"I'd dance in a piece-of-garbage rap or pop video for 50 bucks and make the money last a whole month.\""}, {"text": "=== 1989\u20131996: Professional dancing and early acting roles ===Her most high-profile job as a professional dancer was as a Fly Girl jazz-funk dancer on the sketch comedy television series In Living Color. The show's choreographer, Rosie Perez said she chose Lopez because \"she had that look that I knew the audience would tune in to\". Lopez moved to Los Angeles in late 1991 for the job; she filmed In Living Color during the day and attended acting classes taught by Aaron Speiser at night. Lopez felt ostracized by the other Fly Girls because of her \"voluptuous figure\", and also clashed with Perez. The head of Virgin Records considered signing The Fly Girls as a girl group to rival the Spice Girls, but the deal fell apart. After appearing as a Fly Girl in seasons three and four of In Living Color, Lopez left to work as a backup dancer for Janet Jackson, and appeared in the music video for \"That's the Way Love Goes\". She was scheduled to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but opted to pursue an acting career instead. Lopez hired In Living Color producer Eric Gold as her manager. He advised Lopez to lose weight if she wanted to succeed as an actress."}, {"text": "=== 1989\u20131996: Professional dancing and early acting roles ===Lopez's first professional acting job was a small recurring role on the television show South Central (1994). She was invited to audition for the pilot by a casting director who had seen her speak to camera during a behind-the-scenes In Living Color segment. She then acquired an agent and was cast in the CBS show Second Chances; the series was quickly cancelled, but her popularity with viewers led to her being cast in its spin-off Hotel Malibu. She subsequently appeared in the television film Lost in the Wild (1993). For her first major movie role, in Gregory Nava's 1995 drama Mi Familia, Lopez received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then starred in the action comedy Money Train (1995). The film was not a box office success, though her performance was reviewed positively, which led to her being further noticed in Hollywood. In 1996, Lopez had a supporting role opposite Robin Williams in the comedy Jack, which director Francis Ford Coppola cast her in after seeing her performance in Mi Familia. She next starred opposite Jack Nicholson in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine (1996), where David Rooney of Variety felt she delivered in \"juggling\" the \"smoldering and soulful sides\" of the character."}, {"text": "=== 1997\u20131999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6 ===With her casting as the singer Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez in the biopic Selena (1997), Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn $1 million. She described her salary for the film as a \"statement to the world\", but expressed disappointment that other Latina actors were not being afforded the same opportunities. Despite having previously worked with the film's director Gregory Nava on Mi Familia, Lopez participated in an intense auditioning process and spent time with the late singer's family in Corpus Christi, Texas before filming began. Selena was a box office hit, and Lopez's performance received critical acclaim. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as \"a star-making performance\" and wrote: \"She has the star presence to look convincing in front of 100,000 fans.\" Lopez received her first Golden Globe nomination for the performance. Nava asked the heads of Warner Bros. to fund an Academy Award campaign for Lopez but was told the Academy would \"never nominate a Latina.\" Later in 1997, Lopez starred opposite Ice Cube in the horror film Anaconda, which received negative reviews from critics but was a box office success. Joe Leydon of Variety found the film \"silly\" but said it deserved \"a little credit\" for being \"the first movie of its kind to have a Latina and an African-American\" as its stars. In the crime film U Turn (1997), Lopez appeared topless in a sex scene that was added by director Oliver Stone during filming. Speaking in 2003, Lopez said it was not something \"I would have chosen to do\" and that she and Stone fought over it: \"It's hard being the only woman on a set.\""}, {"text": "=== 1997\u20131999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6 ===Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in the crime caper Out of Sight (1998), Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name. Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, she won rave reviews for her performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times described it as her \"best movie role thus far, and she brings it both seductiveness and grit; if it was hard to imagine a hard-working, pistol-packing bombshell on the page, it couldn't be easier here.\" Turan of the Los Angeles Times described Lopez as \"an actress who can be convincingly tough and devastatingly erotic\" and said the film solidified \"her position as a woman you can confidently build a film around.\" In 2021, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian named Lopez and Clooney's partnership as one of the best examples of on-screen chemistry in cinema history.

With Lopez being a high-profile personality, a bidding war ensued. Tommy Mottola, the head of Sony Music's Work Group, signed her but suggested that she sing in English instead. Her record deal with Sony was described as \"lucrative\", having outbid other offers from Capitol Records and EMI Latin.

Other singles from the album included \"Let's Get Loud\", which became one of Lopez's signature songs, and \"No Me Ames\", a duet with future husband Marc Anthony. In July 1999, she performed \"If You Had My Love\" and \"Let's Get Loud\" at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup closing ceremony.

The Wedding Planner received highly negative reviews but became a box office success. Jessica Winter of The Village Voice found Lopez miscast as a \"buttoned down, celibate\" woman in the film. Lopez titled her album J.Lo after the nickname which her fans and the media had been increasingly referring to her as. She also adopted J.Lo as her stagename. J.Lo received polarized reviews from critics but became the most successful album of her career, selling 12 million copies worldwide. It included the singles \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\", which reached number one in various countries, \"I'm Real\" featuring Ja Rule, which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100, \"Ain't It Funny\", and \"Play\". In support of the album, Lopez performed two-concert residency in Puerto Rico, which was later broadcast in November 2001 as an NBC special, Jennifer Lopez in Concert. It was one of the most-watched concert specials of the year in the United States, with an audience of almost 12 million.

The line catered to women of all sizes, as Lopez felt \"the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored\" in the fashion industry. She also founded her production company, Nuyorican Productions, with manager Benny Medina. Her next film was the romantic drama Angel Eyes, starring opposite Jim Caviezel. Lopez's performance was well-reviewed, though the film was a critical and commercial disappointment.

Then, was released in late 2002, and was heavily influenced by her relationship with then-fianc\u00e9 Ben Affleck. It received mixed critical reviews; Billboard's Michael Paoletta noted the \"considerable growth she reveals as a performer and tunesmith\" on the album, while Jon Caramanica called it \"the least interesting music on the pop charts today.\" The album became a commercial success, achieving the highest opening sales week of her career. The album's lead single \"Jenny from the Block\", which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, was viewed as a response to the notion that Lopez had alienated her \"core fan base: the black and Hispanic hip-hop community.\" The album also spawned the number one single \"All I Have\".

The film received negative reviews; Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt it was \"tacky material\" and was surprised to see \"an actress like Jennifer Lopez\" involved with the project. Her next film was the romantic comedy, Maid in Manhattan (2002), in which Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes as a maid and single mother from the Bronx. It became the highest-grossing film of her career. Reviewing Maid in Manhattan, A. O. Scott of The New York Times enjoyed Lopez as a romantic lead and said \"her greatest skill as an actress\" was \"her ability to melt without cracking the hard shell of composure she wears.\" In 2002 business ventures, Lopez opened Madre's, a Los Angeles restaurant serving Latin cuisine, and released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo.

That year, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli, which was a box-office bomb and is considered one of the worst films of all time. Rex Reed of The Observer criticized the lead actors, calling them \"pathetically incompetent\" in both \"craft and talent\". Roger Ebert agreed that the movie \"doesn't quite work\", but found Lopez and Affleck \"appealing in their performances\" and noted the couple's chemistry.

And my relationship self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\" Months later, she starred opposite Richard Gere in the romantic comedy-drama Shall We Dance?, which was a box-office success.

She released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in early 2005. Its title was symbolic of Lopez's hopes for \"a new professional beginning\". It was recorded during a period where Lopez felt \"a little bit lost, trying to get my footing in a new life\", \"I had just gotten married [to singer Marc Anthony] ... I wasn't with Benny [Medina].\" In a review of Rebirth, journalist Alexis Petridis remarked that the title \"suggests even Lopez has realised that something is amiss with her career ... Despite the highlights, you're still left pondering the question: what happened to Jennifer Lopez?\" The album reached number two on the Billboard 200, but failed to replicate the sales of her previous albums. Its lead single \"Get Right\", however, reached number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of her most successful songs. Also in 2005, Lopez launched her second fashion label, Sweetface, which was geared towards \"high fashion\" in comparison, and appeared in a Kill Bill-inspired Pepsi commercial with Beyonc\u00e9 and David Beckham.

Give Lopez your permission to be good again; she is the same actress now as when we thought her so new and fine.\" In 2006, she reunited with director Gregory Nava  to star in the crime drama Bordertown as a journalist investigating female homicides in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. The film was negatively reviewed and received a direct-to-video release. David D'Arcy of Screen Daily found Lopez \"unconvincing\" as a journalist. In 2007, she starred opposite her then-husband Marc Anthony in the music biopic El Cantante, which told the story of Puerto Rican salsa singer H\u00e9ctor Lavoe and his wife Puchi.

The lead single \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\" reached number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 while the second single \"Me Haces Falta\" failed to chart. Lopez's sixth studio album Brave, released later that year, was her lowest-charting album worldwide.

Lopez's appearance on American Idol in 2011 returned her to prominence. Hannah Elliot of Forbes described it as \"a remarkable comeback\", writing: \"Idol humanized her.

"}, {"text": "=== Entertainment industry ===The highest-paid Latina actress in history, Lopez's film career has been credited with paving the way for greater representation of Latino Americans in Hollywood, which was historically a \"whites-only preserve\". Biographer Kathleen Tracy opined that \"Lopez blazed a trail no openly Latin actress had gone before\", noting that previous Latina stars cosmetically downplayed their ethnicity and changed their names. With Out of Sight (1998), she achieved \"ethnic 'blind' casting\", making her an \"anomaly in the traditionally white space\" of mainstream Hollywood. By deliberately avoiding stereotypical roles, biographer James Robert Parish said Lopez \"helped minimize racial boundaries in show business.\" Her perceived Academy Award snub for Hustlers (2019) was referenced by Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti when announcing a new initiative for Latino representation in Hollywood."}, {"text": "=== Entertainment industry ===With her musical debut, Lopez contributed to the 1990s \"Latin explosion\" in entertainment; The Recording Academy called her the \"breakout female star\" of the Latin pop movement in American music. Historian Roger Bruns considered her \"an influential force in driving a growing Latin cultural influence in popular music\" at the time. Her career ascent has been credited with paving the way for American-born Latina pop artists including Selena Gomez and Becky G, and for Latin American pop artists to venture into English music, including Shakira, Thal\u00eda and Paulina Rubio. Along with Ricky Martin, she helped increase the visibility of Latin music in international markets including East Asia and Canada. Due to her \"multi-tasking career\", she has been described as \"the next-generation Madonna\", and \"the first woman to demonstrate that a Madonna could be a Latina\". "}, {"text": "=== Entertainment industry ===Lopez's music has been credited with helping influence the trajectory of 2000s music, including dance music, Latin music, R&B, and pop rap collaborations. Billboard named her the \"Greatest Pop Star\" of the year 2001. Scholar Miriam Jim\u00e9nez Rom\u00e1n suggested that Lopez, who represents the \"often-suppressed\" history of Puerto Ricans in hip hop culture, was \"able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries\". In 2011, following her return to prominence, Lopez was deemed the \"world's greatest musical comeback act\", based on a study which analysed over one billion Google searches since 2004. In July 2023, Madame Tussauds New York unveiled a wax figure of Lopez inspired by her performance at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show. The figure celebrates her lasting legacy as a multifaceted entertainer."}, {"text": "=== Cultural influence ===Lopez was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. In 2012, Forbes ranked her as the world's most powerful celebrity and the 38th most powerful woman. Latina magazine founder Christy Haubegger attributed Lopez's influence to her being \"the first icon that generationally fits\" young Latino Americans who followed celebrity culture. Lopez was featured on the first cover of Latina in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza writing in 2011 that there is \"no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer\"."}, {"text": "=== Cultural influence ===Jonathan Van Meter of Vogue described Lopez as having \"changed the face of modern celebrity.\" Her ability to start trends has prompted the usage of the phrase \"the J.Lo effect\" in popular culture, which has been used in various different contexts, including the trend of networks hiring \"big name\" judges for reality competition programs after Lopez's successful casting on American Idol. With her moniker J.Lo, Lopez started a trend of celebrities being given abbreviated nicknames, while \"Bennifer\" began the convention of celebrity couple name blending. "}, {"text": "=== Cultural influence ===Described by scholar Helene A. Shugart of the University of Utah as \"arguably the most visible Latina in contemporary mainstream popular culture\", Lopez has been the subject of considerable academic analysis, including in relation to ethnicity, class, \"body politics\", race, Latin culture, and gender. While credited with opening \"the door to [Latino culture having a] broader appeal\", Lopez has also been a polarizing figure, generating \"often vehement disagreement about what is and isn't Latino.\""}, {"text": "=== Cultural influence ===As a result of the public emphasis on her curvaceous figure, Lopez has been credited with influencing a shift in cultural beauty standards. The surge in popularity of buttock augmentation surgery in the early 2000s was attributed to Lopez. In Latin Sensations (2001), Her\u00f3n Marquez wrote: \"Because she wasn't rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold ... Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.\" This has been considered a sign of Lopez's social power in \"changing cultural standards within the mainstream media as a whole\".

The dress had a significant impact on the fashion industry, celebrity endorsements, and the evolution of red carpet fashion.

Lopez has been credited with popularizing various fashion and beauty trends throughout her career. In 2003, she inspired a trend of curvier mannequins being designed, which fuelled a rise in sales for manufacturers and retailers. Lopez's personal style and brand deals have had a considerable effect on sales in the fashion industry. The success of Louis Vuitton's fall 2003 campaign, for which Lopez was the brand's model, led to more Hollywood stars \"becoming image models of fashion and cosmetic labels\". In 2021, The Daily Telegraph reported that she was among ten celebrities whose personal style choices drove the greatest spikes in searches and news coverage for brands. Her appearance at Milan Fashion Week in 2019 generated over $31.8 million in total media impact value.

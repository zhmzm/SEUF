She was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Virl and Tom were both born deaf. Her remaining brothers began performing from an early age as a barbershop quartet and eventually found success on The Andy Williams Show in the 1960s. Her brothers' success prompted the family to move to Los Angeles. In 1964, Marie made her first televised appearance on The Andy Williams Show at four years old.A majority of Marie's childhood was spent at home with her mother Olive, her two eldest brothers (Virl and Tom) and her two youngest brothers (Donny and Jimmy). In her childhood, Marie was closest to Donny and the pair often played together. \"Donny and I were rambunctious playmates who never gave our mother a moment to rest,\" Osmond recounted in her book Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression. She also accompanied her brothers to concerts in her early childhood, often helping organize stage equipment and wardrobes. When the family was home, they spent a lot of their free time singing and harmonizing with each other. \"I never knew a day of my childhood life where music wasn't being played, practiced, written or sung,\" she recalled in 2009."}, {"text": "=== 1973\u20131979: Teenage country music success and collaborations with Donny ===In 1970, The Osmonds rose to commercial stardom with a series of successful pop singles. It was then suggested that Marie would embark on her own music career. Marie chose to be marketed as a country music artist, later citing that it was the only musical genre that allowed women to have a family and career. She recorded a demonstration tape singing Dolly Parton's \"Coat of Many Colors\" that was heard by Don Ovens of MGM Records. Despite being a preteen, Ovens was impressed by her singing and signed her to a solo recording contract with MGM's Nashville division."}, {"text": "=== 1973\u20131979: Teenage country music success and collaborations with Donny ===Ovens convinced country artist Sonny James to produce Osmond's first recording session. In June 1973, Osmond and her mother flew to Nashville, Tennessee where Osmond recorded nine songs which she had memorized prior to the session. Among the songs was \"Paper Roses\", which was chosen by James himself. It was decided that \"Paper Roses\" would be released as Osmond's debut single in August 1973. The song later reached the number one spot on both the US country songs chart and the Canadian country tracks chart. The song also crossed over to the US Hot 100, peaking at number five and went to number two in the United Kingdom. Osmond's debut studio album was released in September 1973 and topped the US country albums chart.

Two corresponding studio albums named after Osmond's follow-up singles charted on the US country chart in 1974 and 1975 respectively.By the early 1970s, Donny Osmond had established his own recording career apart from The Osmonds. During this period, Donny was in the studio recording a song called \"I'm Leaving It All Up to You\". Because he was having difficulty hitting the song's high notes, Marie was brought in to sing harmony. Released as \"Donny and Marie Osmond\", the song reached number four on the US Hot 100, while also reaching the top five in Canada, The Netherlands, Ireland and the UK. An album of the same name sold over 500,000 copies in the US and spawned another international top ten single: \"Morning Side of the Mountain\".

Along with her previous project, I Only Wanted You made the top 20 of the US country albums chart. The album featured a duet with Paul Davis called \"You're Still New to Me\". Although Davis had pitched her the song, it was Osmond's idea to record the song as a duet with him. Released as a single in 1986, the duet topped the US and Canadian country charts. The album's title track reached the top 20 on both nation's country charts in 1987.In July 1988, Osmond's next studio album All in Love was released.

The album contained some new recordings, one of which was the single \"Like a Hurricane\". It reached number 57 on the US country songs chart the same year. Another new track was a re-recording of \"Paper Roses\", which Osmond cut again due to copyright challenges with including the original on the disc. Osmond brought in the song's original producer (Sonny James) and several of the original studio musicians to re-make the track. In 1995, Osmond returned to the US country charts with the new Curb single \"What Kind of Man (Walks on a Woman)\". Two previews of songs from an anticipated album were included in the single release.

The show had a total of 1730 performances, the most of any singing act in Las Vegas history. The duo earned three of the Las Vegas Review-Journal's Best of Las Vegas Awards in 2012 including \"Best Show\", \"Best All-Around Performer\" (Donny & Marie), and \"Best Singer\".

Music Is Medicine reached number ten on the US country chart, becoming Osmond's first solo album since Paper Roses to make the top ten list. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album three out of five stars and concluded, \"Despite the ambitious cast of characters, it's music that's meant to soothe and comfort old friends, and it certainly succeeds in that regard.\"In 2021, Osmond's next studio album was released titled Unexpected. The project was a collection of operatic and traditional pop music. Although fearful about recording an album of material outside her traditional comfort zone, Osmond decided to \"not be afraid of a new door opening\".

In describing her wide range of musical styles, The Blade wrote, \"To hear Marie Osmond\u2019s voice is to hear more than a half century of American pop culture history.\" In describing the country pop era of her career, writers Robert K. Oermann and Mary A. Bufwack wrote, \"Like the other country-pop crossover queens of her era, Marie had a patriotic, high-energy fashion conscious concert act that matched her upbeat pop-flavored tunes.\" When explaining her own musical styles, Osmond said, \"Yes, I\u2019m country; that\u2019s what I chose to be, but it was very easy for me to sing pop because my brothers did.

The pair became known for the show's opening song which featured the line, \"I'm a little bit country [in reference to Marie] and I'm a little bit rock and roll [in reference to Donny]\".The Donny & Marie show was considered by writers to showcase the siblings' \"squeaky clean\" and \"family friendly\" image. The siblings often worked 18-hour days learning scripts, changing into costumes and practicing choreography. Marie also attended to domestic and school responsibilities. She was tutored on-set for three hours daily and was expected to complete chores while she was home. Weighing 110 pounds, Marie was told by a producer to lose ten pounds or \"the entire show would be canceled\".

I was being scrutinized in the tabloids and the paparazzi seemed to show up wherever I went. I was emotionally exhausted,\" she wrote in her autobiography. In 1986, she remarried record producer Brian Blosil in a private ceremony with her family in attendance. Osmond was drawn to Blosil's \"dry sense of humor\" after meeting at a family party. Osmond and Blosil had seven children, five of whom were adopted. Their two biological children are Rachael and Matthew. Their five adopted children are Jessica, Michael, Brandon, Brianna, and Abigail. After 21 years of marriage, the couple divorced in 2007. Both parties released a joint statement stating that neither one assigned fault for the divorce.Following her second divorce, Osmond said she \"never wanted to be married again\". Osmond and her former husband Steve Craig then saw each other again with the assistance of their son. They rekindled their relationship and secretly dated for two years before revealing it publicly. \"I didn't want anybody to get hurt, you know if it didn't work out. And gosh, it just worked out,\" Osmond said. The couple then remarried on May 5, 2011 in a private ceremony at the Las Vegas Mormon Temple. For the ceremony, Osmond wore her dress from their original 1982 wedding. The couple remarried a few months before attending their son's wedding. \"The thing about a second marriage is that you realize things you thought were so important, aren't. I love being with my husband. He is the sweetest man I know. He lives to serve and really listens to people's needs,\" she told People magazine.It was also revealed that Osmond's daughter identifies as a lesbian. In a later interview, Osmond commented, \"I know how I love my children and I know God loves all of his children as a father. I pray for everyone to use their lives to be happy and feel accomplished. That is what this life is for.\"In March 2020, she stated that she will leave her fortune to charity upon her death, stating that it would be a disservice to her children to leave the money to them, and noting that they need to make their own money."}, {"text": "=== Personal setbacks and challenges ===In 1976, Karl Engemann began managing the recording careers of Donny, Marie, Jimmy Osmond and the Osmond Brothers group. In 1979 Engemann was appointed personal manager at various career stages of all the Osmond children, and eventually only of Marie Osmond. In December 2009, Marie Osmond parted company with Karl Engemann. Osmond and her law firm wrote that Engemann made \"repeated defamatory and derogatory comments to third parties, multiple breaches of fiduciary duties, entering into unauthorized commitments, seeking to obtain monies outside the purview of the management agreement and other violations of his obligations.\""}, {"text": "=== Personal setbacks and challenges ===In 1999, Osmond publicly spoke about her battle with postpartum depression after giving birth to her last child. She spoke in detail about her challenges in her 2001 book Behind the Smile. In the book, she explained that it felt \"much darker\" than the baby blues and that she was \"fading away minute by minute\". Osmond started experiencing panic attacks, fatigue, neck pain (which resulted in a hospital visit) and suicidal ideations. In one instance, she drove miles up California's Pacific Coast Highway leaving her children in the care of two nannies who did not know where she was going. Osmond then received a call from her second husband who convinced her to pull off the highway and check into a hotel. She then began receiving natural healing treatments through physician Dr. Judith Moore. Osmond found that both medication and work on healing her own childhood trauma ultimately lifted her depression. After discussing postpartum depression on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Osmond said that she received \"thousands of emails and handwritten letters\" from people about their own struggles with the disease.Osmond also revealed in her 2001 book that she had been sexually abused in her youth. Her abuser was not publicly revealed. She believed that the abuse resulted her in her struggles with postpartum depression. \"In my life, the normally positive quality of putting others first resulted in long-term negative effects because it was out of balance,\" she wrote. She later revealed that her childhood abuse also resulted in developing body dysmorphia.In August 2006, several U.S. tabloids suggested that she had attempted suicide. Those reports were denied by her publicity team, which claimed she had suffered an adverse reaction to a medication she was taking.On February 26, 2010, Osmond adopted son Michael took his own life after jumping off an eighth-floor balcony. He reportedly battled depression and addiction and had been in rehabilitation at the age of 12. He was also bullied from a young age. Osmond wrote in her 2013 book The Key Is Love that he had been \"emotionally down\" in the weeks prior to his suicide. Shortly before taking his own life, Osmond had missed a phone call from her son because she was onstage in Las Vegas. An autopsy found no drugs in his system. Osmond returned to work two weeks following her son's death. \"The stage is my safe place. It doesn't scare me like it scares people. And I knew if I didn't get back onstage I may never get back onstage.\""}, {"text": "== Filmography ==FilmsHugo the Hippo (1975)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Goin' Coconuts (1978)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==The Velveteen Rabbit (1984)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==Buster & Chauncey's Silent Night (1998)"}, {"text": "== Filmography ==O Christmas Tree (1999)"}, {"text": "== Books ==Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression (2001) (with Marcia Wilkie and Dr. Judith Moore)"}, {"text": "== Books ==Might as Well Laugh About It Now (2009) (with Marcia Wilkie)"}, {"text": "== Books ==Marie Osmond's Heartfelt Giving: Sew and Quilt for Family and Friends (2010)"}, {"text": "== Books ==The Key Is Love: My Mother's Wisdom, A Daughter's Gratitude (2013) (with Marcia Wilkie)"}, {"text": "== Awards and nominations ==Marie Osmond has received several awards and nominations, notably from the Academy of Country Music, Country Music Association, Grammy Awards and Daytime Emmy Awards."}, {"text": "== External links ==Marie Osmond Official website"}, {"text": "== External links ==Marie Osmond at IMDb"}, {"text": "== External links ==Marie Osmond at the Internet Broadway Database "}, {"text": "== External links ==Marie Osmond Getting Divorced \u2013 People magazine, March 30, 2007"}, {"text": "== External links ==BBC News, Marie Osmond sings Paper Roses for Kilmarnock fans, 1 February 2013"}]

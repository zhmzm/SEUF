Other circumstances that contributed to his death included the effects of buprenorphine, drowning, and coronary artery disease. The LA County medical examiner said in a statement that \"at the high levels of ketamine found in his post-mortem blood specimens, the main lethal effects would be from both cardiovascular overstimulation and respiratory depression,\" while \"drowning contributes due to the likelihood of submersion into the pool as he lapsed into unconsciousness; coronary artery disease contributes due to exacerbation of ketamine induced myocardial effects on the heart\". Perry had been receiving ketamine-assisted psychotherapy sessions to treat anxiety at the time of his death, his last known session of which having been the week prior to his death. However, the report stated, \"The ketamine in his system at death could not be from that infusion therapy, since ketamine's half-life is 3 to 4 hours, or less\"."}, {"text": "== Publications ==Perry, Matthew (November 1, 2022).

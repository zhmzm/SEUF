With only a few television roles and small film appearances, the 23-year-old Pfeiffer was an unknown actress when she attended the casting call audition for the role, but according to director Patricia Birch, she won the part because she \"has a quirky quality you don't expect\". The film was a critical and commercial failure but Pfeiffer's performance was noted as a standout. The New York Times remarked: \"[A]lthough she is a relative screen newcomer, Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and comfortable than anyone else in the cast.\" Despite escaping the critical mauling, her agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that \"she couldn't get any jobs.

She finally scored a major box-office hit as Sukie Ridgemont in the 1987 adaptation of John Updike's novel The Witches of Eastwick, with Jack Nicholson, Cher, and Susan Sarandon. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $63.7 million domestically, equivalent to $171 million in 2023 dollars, becoming one of her earliest critical and commercial successes.

Hal Hinson of The Washington Post saw Pfeiffer's role as \"the least obvious and the most difficult. Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it. Her porcelain-skinned beauty, in this regard, is a great asset, and the way it's used makes it seem an aspect of her spirituality.\" She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress."}, {"text": "=== Late 1970s and 1980s ===Pfeiffer then accepted the role of Susie Diamond, a hard-edged former call girl turned lounge singer, in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), which also starred Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Baker Boys.

The film was a modest success, grossing $18.4 million in the US and Canada (equivalent to $45 million in 2023 dollars ). Her portrayal of Susie, however, drew unanimous acclaim from critics. Critic Roger Ebert compared her to Rita Hayworth in Gilda and to Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot, adding that the film was \"one of the movies they will use as a document, years from now, when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star\". During the 1989\u20131990 awards season, Pfeiffer won as Best Actress at the Golden Globes, the National Board of Review, the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the Chicago Film Critics Association.

Pfeiffer then landed the role of damaged waitress Frankie in Garry Marshall's Frankie and Johnny (1991), a film adaptation of Terrence McNally's Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, which reunited her with her Scarface co-star, Al Pacino. The casting was seen as controversial by many, as Pfeiffer was considered far too beautiful to play an \"ordinary\" waitress; Kathy Bates, the original Frankie on Broadway, also expressed disappointment over the producers' choice.

Pfeiffer received unanimous critical acclaim for her portrayal, which is often referred to as the greatest performance of Catwoman of all time by critics and fans. Premiere retrospectively stated: \"Arguably the outstanding villain of the Tim Burton era, Michelle Pfeiffer's deadly kitten with a whip brought sex to the normally neutered franchise. Her stitched-together, black patent leather costume, based on a sketch of Burton's, remains the character's most iconic look.

Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called Original Sin (2001).

She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama I Am Sam (2001), with Sean Penn. Despite grossing $97.8 million worldwide, the film was unfavourably reviewed by critics; Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: \"Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by the bland clich\u00e9s that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever.\" Meanwhile, SF Gate observed: \"In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life.

After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him \"You know, you really can fire me,\" but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely out of the public eye to devote time to her husband and children.

Although a fan of Pfeiffer's work in the musicals Grease 2 and The Fabulous Baker Boys, director Adam Shankman cast Pfeiffer largely based on her performance in Batman Returns, claiming she was his first and only choice for Velma. Although she had fun with the part, Pfeiffer described Velma as the most difficult role she had played at the time, because of her character's racism; but she was drawn to the film's important message of anti-bigotry, accepting that \"in order to do a movie about racism, somebody has got to be the racist\". Released to widely positive reviews, Hairspray grossed $202.5 million worldwide. Pfeiffer's performance was also critically acclaimed, with film critic David Edelstein of NPR calling her \"sublime\".

The film received mostly positive reviews but performed moderately at the box office, earning $135.5 million globally.

Her reported salary was US$1 million, with an advance on 15 percent of the gross. However, the film was only distributed on home video markets domestically.

Ch\u00e9ri premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, where it received a nomination for the Golden Bear award. The Times of London reviewed the film favorably, describing Hampton's screenplay as a \"steady flow of dry quips and acerbic one-liners\" and Pfeiffer's performance as \"magnetic and subtle, her worldly nonchalance a mask for vulnerability and heartache\". Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that it was \"fascinating to observe how Pfeiffer controls her face and voice during times of painful hurt\". Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times praised the \"wordless scenes that catch L\u00e9a unawares, with the camera alone seeing the despair and regret that she hides from the world.

Pfeiffer claims she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them compelling, and prefers drama over comedy. She has also described acting as a \"sadomasochistic\" profession, due to how \"brutal\" she finds the process can be at times."}, {"text": "== Acting style and reception ==During the 1980s, Pfeiffer typically played smart, funny, and independent women, and pursued a wider range of roles in the 1990s. Early in her career, Pfeifer mostly played relatable working class women, apart from the occasional upper class character. She has admitted to enjoying playing imperfect, evil, and \"slightly trashy\" females. In a 2021 profile, Lynn Hirschberg of W said Pfeiffer excels in emotionally conflicted roles, while Adam Platt of New Woman and journalist Bilge Ebiri agreed that she tends to play emotionally detached women. Backstage contributor Manuel Betancourt observed parallels between Pfeiffer's roles and her own determination to subvert expectations, with the actress confirming that she searches for relatability when selecting new projects. However, Town & Country senior editor Adam Rathe finds Pfeiffer dissimilar to most of her characters. Known to be highly selective about potential projects, IndieWire contributor Kate Erbland believes Pfeiffer carefully chooses unconventional roles to avoid being typecast, although Pfeiffer claims to not know what her ideal type is. Pfeiffer's colleagues have described her as extremely committed, competent, and prepared when it comes to her work, but she refuses to watch her own performances."}, {"text": "== Acting style and reception ==Pfeiffer has been called one of the greatest actresses of her generation. However, she has often been deemed one of Hollywood's most underrated, with The Hollywood Reporter saying she \"is too seldom ranked among the best of her generation\". In 2009, Maclean's film critic Brian D. Johnson argued that Pfeiffer had yet to demonstrate her true acting range, believing she could potentially be as revered as Meryl Streep if afforded the same opportunities, while the San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle remarked that Pfeiffer's humility sometimes causes the public to overlook her as one of the industry's finest actresses. Pfeiffer is particularly renowned for her versatility, having accumulated a diverse filmography that spans period, romance, fantasy, musical, comedy, and drama. By 2016, Salon's Charles Taylor declared that no actor of the previous decade had rivaled Pfeiffer's versatility. Summarizing her career as eclectic, Erbland believes she has rarely repeated acting choices, with the actress confirming she had always aspired to play the widest range of characters possible, even when her opportunities were limited."}, {"text": "== Acting style and reception ==Pfeiffer was one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1980s and 1990s, typically earning $9\u2013$10 million per film during the latter decade. Aside from The Witches of Eastwick, few of her films during the 1980s had been major box office successes, an observation Pfeiffer feared disclosing to film studios. In 1995, The New York Times journalist Bernard Weinraub said Pfeiffer belongs to a group of respected actresses who are \"not considered a big box-office draw\". However, several critics reported that her performances garnered consistent acclaim, despite some mediocre films and box office returns. Regardless, she was the sixth highest-grossing domestic box office star of 1990, and one of the few actresses whose salary corresponded with their box office appeal as of 1996, according to UPI. By 1999, Variety named Pfeiffer \"the female movie star most likely to improve a film's box-office appeal\". Film critic Robyn Karney wrote that among the several blond, attractive actresses who debuted during the 1980s, Pfeiffer was the most reminiscent of classic Hollywood legends, likening her to Carole Lombard. However, Karney felt the declining quality of her work towards the end of the century was a sobering reminder that \"the great female movie star of the Golden Age is no more\". Pfeiffer feels critics have not always understood her acting decisions, which Rathe attributed to the \"wildcard image\" she has maintained throughout her career, and has expressed that she is sometimes surprised by their reviews, whether positive or negative."}, {"text": "== Acting style and reception ==Pfeiffer has yet to receive top-billing in a blockbuster film, despite being one of the word's biggest and most acclaimed movie stars. Entertainment journalist James Ulmer ranked her the world's third most bankable actress in 1998, and the 27th most influential actor in the world in 2000. The Kenosha News voted Pfeiffer America's 26th favorite actress. The Boston Globe's Mark Shanahan believes Pfeiffer is sometimes overlooked as one of Hollywood's greatest leading ladies due to her perceived effortlessness. Matthew Jacobs of HuffPost Canada hailed her as \"one of the great comedic actors of our time, though she is rarely recognized as such\". The author identified subtlety as one of her strengths, explaining that her \"magnetism never overwhelms the movies she's in. Even when she is the most talented person on-screen\". Describing her as \"one of the industry's greatest stars during its pre-millennial twilight\", ABC Online's Luke Goodsell declared Pfeiffer's comparatively sparse workload \"[a]mong the many depressing phenomena of 21st-century Hollywood\".

After being typecast in early roles based on her appearance, Pfeiffer struggled to convince directors to take her seriously as an actor, and sought out more challenging opportunities.

In 1990, Pfeiffer appeared on the inaugural cover of People magazine's annual \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" issue. She has been featured in the \"Most Beautiful\" issue a record-breaking six times throughout the decade (from 1990 to 1993, and in 1996 and 1999). In 2004, the magazine named her one of the most beautiful women of all time. In 2011, the Los Angeles Times Magazine featured her among the \"50 Most Beautiful Women in Film\". In 2020, Vogue Paris listed Pfeiffer as one of the 21 most beautiful American actresses of all time. Men's Health ranked Pfeiffer 45th and 67th on their all-time hottest women and sex symbol rankings, respectively. Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her appearance, at times mocking her trademark features. At least two of her films, Stardust (2007) and Ch\u00e9ri (2009), explore beautiful, youth-obsessed women struggling to accept aging, themes with which Pfeiffer personally identified. According to several plastic surgeons, she possesses some of the most requested celebrity features among clients. In 2001, plastic surgeon Stephen R. Marquardt declared Pfeiffer the most beautiful face in Hollywood. Nicknamed the \"golden ratio\", Marquardt claims Pfeiffer's face adheres to a mathematical formula in which he determined a person's ideal mouth is 1.618 times as wide as their nose. Several media publications have commented on Pfeiffer's perceived ability to physically age slowly."}, {"text": "== Public image ==Famous for being fiercely private like the characters she plays, Matthew Jacobs of HuffPost crowned Pfeiffer Hollywood's prime example of \"a movie star who doesn't walk around feeling like a movie star\", which benefits her ability to play authentic characters without allowing her fame to affect her talent. Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking press interviews, referring to herself as \"the worst interviewee that ever was\", and maintaining that it is not an actor's responsibility to promote a film project. The Baltimore Sun film critic Michael Sragow observed that the actress can at times appear \"flustered or elusive\" during interviews. Journalist Timothy Egan once likened profiling Pfeiffer to covering geology, which she outgrew by 1995. Vikram Murthi of The Nation believes Pfeiffer's aversion to publicity \"has lent her an air of gravitas, of someone who directs a spotlight rather than chases after it\"."}, {"text": "== Public image ==Media commentators noted that Pfeiffer had unexpectedly become a \"pop-music muse\" in 2014; her name is mentioned in two of the year's most popular songs: \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars, and \"Riptide\" by Vance Joy. Joy was particularly inspired by Pfeiffer's transformation from Selina Kyle into Catwoman in Batman Returns, whereas Ronson cited The Fabulous Baker Boys as his favorite Pfeiffer film.

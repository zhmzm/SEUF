A double album edition, subtitled The Anthology, was surprise-released on the same day, containing 15 additional songs."}, {"text": "=== Genres ===Swift has reinvented her musical identity with each album release, earning descriptions as a musical \"chameleon\" from Time and the BBC. In her early career, her musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks, and the country crossover music of Keith Urban, which incorporated rock, pop, and blues. She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift (2006) to Red (2012). The albums featured country signifiers such as banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, but music critics noted their pop melodies and rock influences; for example, Speak Now (2010) drew on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock. Swift's country-music identity received contrarian commentary; critics argued that country was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical direction and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots. The music journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\"."}, {"text": "=== Genres ===After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna. 1989 (2014) was the first album in this direction, incorporating dense synthesizers and electronic arrangements. Swift expanded on the electronic production on Reputation (2017), Lover (2019), and Midnights (2022), incorporating other pop styles such as pop rock, electropop, and dream pop. On each album, she also experimented with other genres: Reputation consisted of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences; Lover featured a 1980s-influenced synth-driven production; and Midnights was characterized by a minimalist, subdued sound. When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity. Others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism."}, {"text": "=== Genres ===Her 2020 pandemic albums Folklore and Evermore explored alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, which resulted in a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads. The latter further experimented with varied song structures, time signatures, and instruments. Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter."}, {"text": "=== Voice ===Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, and a generally soft but versatile timbre. As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries. Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve. Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\". They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune."}, {"text": "=== Voice ===The Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling\u2014\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\". With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\", swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles. Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres."}, {"text": "=== Voice ===Reviews of Swift's later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful. With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice. Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\". With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice. An i review said Swift's voice is \"leagues better now\". The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift's voice, and that her country twang faded away. Midnights received acclaim for Swift's nuanced vocal delivery. She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals. The musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift's timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower."}, {"text": "=== Songwriting ===Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations. She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them. Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton; 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette; Joni Mitchell; and Fall Out Boy. She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs. Her literary influences included the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson; the lattermost of whom was a distant cousin of Swift."}, {"text": "=== Songwriting ===In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\". Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life. Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody. On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes. She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red, and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989. Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame, and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\". Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship, alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism."}, {"text": "=== Songwriting ===Her confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music. Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\". NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\", remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\". Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\". Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist. Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs."}, {"text": "=== Songwriting ===On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives. She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry. Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success. According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore. Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\"."}, {"text": "=== Songwriting ===Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous. Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album. Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\". The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times, and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022. Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\"."}, {"text": "=== Songwriting ===Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications. Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare among her peers. Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs, earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time. Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\"."}, {"text": "=== Performances ===Journalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence, Swift commands large audiences, without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do. According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\". In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\" In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour, and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\"."}, {"text": "=== Performances ===Critics have highlighted Swift's versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums. Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology, and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007. Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar; acoustic guitar; piano; and sometimes twelve-string guitar, banjo, or ukulele. Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection. Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\". Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\", and the 21st century's most popular performer."}, {"text": "=== Video and film ===Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process. She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011 and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before. In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe.

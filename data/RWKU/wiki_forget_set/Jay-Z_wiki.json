He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father, Adnis Reeves, abandoned the family, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry.He attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey.

Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O."}, {"text": "== Career ==Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\"According to his second verse on \"99 Problems\", released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after. Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was \"In My Lifetime\", which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995.

After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics. This album would later be included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status. After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Featuring production by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States.In 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland. Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and \"Nigga What, Nigga Who\", featuring Amil and Jaz-O. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5\u00d7 Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies.

He later performed the song \"Takeover\", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson. A line at the end of \"Takeover\" referred to Nas, who criticized him on \"We Will Survive\". Nas responded with a diss track called \"Ether\" and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to \"Takeover\" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences.On September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, The Blueprint, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine The Source.

Despite Jay-Z's sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023.Jay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, The Best of Both Worlds in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse\u2014a double album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S. and surpassing The Blueprint. It yielded a single-disc re-issue, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which features Jay-Z's then-girlfriend, Beyonc\u00e9, and contained the track \"A Dream\", featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single \"La-La-La\", which was a sequel to \"Excuse Me Miss\" and failed to match its commercial success."}, {"text": "=== 2003\u20132005: The Black Album and initial retirement ===After visiting the south of France, Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, The Black Album at the opening of the 40/40 Club.

Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004.Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies. Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake. The publicized split between Jay-Z, Dash, and Biggs led to the former partners sending jabs at each other in interviews."}, {"text": "=== 2005\u20132007: Kingdom Come and American Gangster ===On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals. The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Mar\u00ed, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans.

At the start of the album's first single, \"Blue Magic\", Jay-Z offers a dealer's manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: \"Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert.\" Also notable about the \"Blue Magic\" music video was Jay-Z flashing \u20ac500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a \"turning point in American pop culture's response to globalization.\" The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S. On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam."}, {"text": "=== 2008\u20132011: The Blueprint 3 and Watch the Throne ===In winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain's Glastonbury Festival. Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. \"I'm sorry, but Jay-Z?\" Gallagher asked, swearing. \"No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night\u2014you go, 'Kylie Minogue? I don't know about that', do you know what I mean?\u2014but I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It's wrong.\" As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, \"We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward.\" Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song \"Wonderwall\", and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark, Hove Festival in Norway and O2 Wireless Festival in London.

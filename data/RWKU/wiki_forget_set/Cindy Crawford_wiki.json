[{"text": "Cynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model. During the 1980s and 1990s, she was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers and runways, as well as fashion campaigns. She subsequently expanded into acting and business ventures."}, {"text": "== Early life ==Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966, the daughter of Daniel Kenneth Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (n\u00e9e Walker). She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle, and a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3. On social media, she has stated that her family had been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry was mostly German, English, and French. She is a descendant of English Puritan settler Thomas Trowbridge, who helped establish the Congregational Church in New Haven. She was raised in the Congregationalist faith and found it \u201cincredible\u201d that religious values \u201ctrickled down\" to her family. According to official census records, Crawford\u2019s paternal great-grandfather David Crawford was of Scottish ancestry from Ulster, Northern Ireland who settled in Wisconsin. Appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included European nobility and that she was descended from Charlemagne.In her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modeling work, only to discover it was a prank by two of her classmates. However, the following year, another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week's coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford's first cover. The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. Initially, she worked with a small agency, which was sold to Elite Model Management shortly after she signed. In 1983, she entered Elite's Look of the Year contest at 17 and made the national finals.Crawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian. She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one quarter before dropping out to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, she moved to New York City in 1986 and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency."}, {"text": "== Career ==In 1987, Crawford appeared in the opening credits of the Michael J.

In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy's list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century.

In 1992, Crawford\u2014through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions\u2014made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some for being unsafe, it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape.

He was christened Henry Charles Albert David on 21 December 1984 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by Robert Runcie, the then Archbishop of Canterbury. Growing up, he was referred to as \"Harry\" by family, friends, and the public, and was nicknamed \"Harold\" by his brother. Harry and his elder brother, William, were raised at Kensington Palace in London, and Highgrove House in Gloucestershire. Diana wanted her sons to have a broader range of experiences and a better understanding of ordinary life than previous royal children. She took them to venues that ranged from Walt Disney World and McDonald's to AIDS clinics and homeless shelters. Harry began accompanying his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.

His mother died in a car crash in Paris the following year while he and William were staying with their father at Balmoral Castle. Their father informed them about their mother's death. At his mother's funeral, Harry, then aged 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and maternal uncle Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, in walking behind the funeral cort\u00e8ge from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey. Harry and his brother William inherited the \"bulk\" of the \u00a312.9 million left by their mother on their respective 30th birthdays, a figure that had grown since her 1997 death to \u00a310 million each in 2014. In 2014 Harry and William inherited their mother's wedding dress along with many of her other personal possessions, including dresses, diamond tiaras, jewels, letters, and paintings. The brothers also received the original lyrics and score of \"Candle in the Wind\", by Bernie Taupin and Elton John, as performed by John at Diana's funeral. In 2002 The Times reported that Harry would also share with his brother a disbursement of \u00a34.9 million from trust funds established by their great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on their respective 21st birthdays and would share a disbursement of \u00a38 million upon their respective 40th birthdays.

He started at London's Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School. Following this, he attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire. After passing entrance exams, he was admitted to Eton College. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the past practice of the Mountbatten-Windsors to send children to Gordonstoun, which his grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins had attended. It did, however, see Harry follow in his elder brother's footsteps and the Spencer family's, as both his mother's father and her brother attended Eton.

On 18 September 2012, it was reported that Harry had been moved to a safe location after an attack by the Taliban on Camp Bastion that killed two US marines. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond stated that \"additional security arrangements\" were put in place, for Harry could be a potential target, but added that he would face \"the same risk as any other Apache pilot\" while in combat. In files obtained on the incident, Major General Gregg A. Sturdevant was quoted as saying \"The night of the attack, he slept through the entire thing. We didn't do anything special for him.

At the beginning of trial, MGN apologised for one instance of unlawful information gathering against Harry and added that his legal challenge \"warrants compensation\". In June 2023, Harry testified in the court case accusing former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan of horrific personal attacks and claimed that his phone had been hacked dating back to when he was still at Eton. His appearance marked the first time a member of the royal family had been cross-examined in court since Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, appeared as a witness in court in 1891. In December 2023, the High Court ruled in favour of Harry for 15 of the 33 sample stories used in his claims of phone hacking against MGN and awarded him \u00a3140,600 of the \u00a3440,000 he sought in damages. Mr Justice Fancourt concluded Piers Morgan and other editors knew about the phone hacking at their publications and were involved in it. Harry through his lawyer David Sherborne called the ruling \"vindicating and affirming\" and urged the authorities to further investigate and prosecute the company. An additional 115 articles from Harry's claim might have been the focus of two further trials, but in February 2024 he settled his claim with MGN. The publisher agreed to cover Harry's legal costs and pay damages reported to be in the region of \u00a3300,000."}, {"text": "==== Other cases ====In October 2013, Jo Brand appeared on Have I Got News for You and while talking about Prince George's christening she said: \"George's godparents include Hugh van Cutsem ... I presume that's a nickname as in Hugh van cuts 'em and Harry then snorts 'em.\" Representatives of Kensington Palace contacted the BBC after the programme aired, pointing out the error and the implications of the joke. The BBC wrote to Kensington Palace apologising for the \"factual inaccuracy\" as George's godfather was William van Cutsem, but it did not apologise for the comment itself as it was part of the show's \"irreverent humor\"."}, {"text": "==== Other cases ====In February 2014, a judge sentenced the convicted criminal Ashraf Islam to three years in prison, as he had plotted to murder Harry and had given it \"considerable thought\" due to his belief that Harry had \"a moral guilt\" since he was in the army.

The agency also agreed to pay damages and legal costs associated with the case. In December 2019, PA Media retracted the publishing of a Christmas card photograph of Harry, Meghan, and their son Archie. The agency said that the photo was retracted because they had been advised that the photograph was \"not representative of the Christmas card sent by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\". In January 2020, lawyers issued a legal warning to the press after paparazzi photographs were published in the media. In March 2020, the couple took Splash UK to court after the Duchess and their son were photographed without permission during a \"private family outing\" while staying in Canada. The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorised photos of the family. In April 2020, the Duke and Duchess announced that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Mirror and the Express.

It was alleged that the Sun had made two payments amounting to \u00a34,000 to the partner of a royal official in relation to stories published in June and July 2019 which detailed the nannying and god-parenting arrangements for Harry and Meghan's son Archie. News Group Newspapers, publisher of the Sun, emphasised that they had done nothing \"unlawful\" in sourcing the stories and no illegal payments were made. Wootton's lawyers denied that any payments were made unlawfully to a public official or a proxy and described the claims as \"a smear campaign by unknown bad actors.\" Wootton has been credited with breaking the story about Megxit and Harry and Meghan's initial plans for moving to Canada in the Sun on 8 January 2020, which prompted the couple to issue an announcement within hours, confirming their plans for stepping back from their royal duties. Sources close to the couple later spoke to The New York Times, stating that they \"felt forced to disclose their plans prematurely\" as they learned about the Sun's intentions to publish the story. Wootton disputed the claim as \"They released the statement after we had published the story and had so much notice.\""}, {"text": "==== Other cases ====A September 2020 article by The Times claiming an Invictus Games fundraiser had been cancelled due to its affiliation with a competitor of Netflix, Harry's business partner, became the subject of a legal complaint issued by the Duke.

The report prompted an investigation by Twitter. Twitter stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts, and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy. Bot Sentinel also released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube.

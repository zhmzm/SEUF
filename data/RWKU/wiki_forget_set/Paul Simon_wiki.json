[{"text": "Paul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter known both for his solo work and his collaboration with Art Garfunkel. He and his school friend Garfunkel, whom he met in 1953, came to prominence in the 1960s as Simon & Garfunkel. Their blend of folk and rock, including hits such as \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"America\" and \"The Boxer\", served as a soundtrack to the counterculture movement. Their final album, Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970), is among the bestselling of all time.  "}, {"text": "As a solo artist, Simon has explored genres including gospel, reggae and soul. His albums Paul Simon (1972), There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973), and Still Crazy After All These Years (1975) kept him in the public eye and drew acclaim, producing the hits \"Mother and Child Reunion\", \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\", and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\". Simon reunited with Garfunkel for several tours and the 1981 Concert in Central Park. "}, {"text": "In 1986, Simon released his most successful and acclaimed album, Graceland, incorporating South African influences. \"You Can Call Me Al\" became one of Simon's most successful singles. Graceland was followed by The Rhythm of the Saints (1990), and a second Concert in the Park in 1991, without Garfunkel, which was attended by half a million people. In 1988, Simon wrote a Broadway musical, The Capeman, which was poorly received. In the 21st century, Simon continued to record and tour. His later albums, such as You're the One (2000), So Beautiful or So What (2011) and Stranger to Stranger (2016), introduced him to new generations. Simon retired from touring in 2018, but continued to record music. An album, Seven Psalms, was released in May 2023."}, {"text": "Simon is among the world's best-selling music artists. He has twice been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and has been the recipient of sixteen Grammy Awards, including three for Album of the Year. Two of his works, Sounds of Silence and Graceland, were inducted into the National Recording Registry for their cultural significance, and in 2007, the Library of Congress voted him the inaugural winner of the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. He is a co-founder of the Children's Health Fund, a nonprofit organization that provides medical care to children."}, {"text": "== Early life ==Simon was born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, to Hungarian-Jewish parents. His father, Louis (1916\u20131995), a professor of education at the City College of New York, was a double-bass player and dance bandleader who performed under the name Lee Sims. His mother, Belle (1910\u20132007), was an elementary-school teacher. In 1945, his family moved to the Kew Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City."}, {"text": "== Early life ==The musician Donald Fagen described Simon's childhood as that of \"a certain kind of New York Jew, almost a stereotype really, to whom music and baseball are very important. I think it has to do with the parents. The parents are either immigrants or first-generation Americans who felt like outsiders, and assimilation was the key thought\u2014they gravitated to black music and baseball, looking for an alternative culture.\" Simon said Fagen's description was not far from the truth. Simon played baseball and stickball as a child. He described his father as funny and smart, but said he worked late and did not see his children much."}, {"text": "== Early life ==Simon met Art Garfunkel when they were 11 years old "}, {"text": "== Early life ==and performed together in a production of Alice in Wonderland for their sixth-grade graduation. The two began singing together at the age of 13, occasionally performing at school dances. At the age of 12 or 13 Simon wrote his first song, \"The Girl for Me\", for him and Art Garfunkel to perform. According to Simon, it became the \"neighborhood hit\". His father wrote the words and chords on paper for the boys to use, and that paper became the first officially copyrighted Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song. It is now in the Library of Congress. In 1957, in their mid-teens, they recorded the song \"Hey, Schoolgirl\" under the name \"Tom & Jerry\", a name that was given to them by their label, Big Records.

He and Garfunkel occasionally reunited as Tom & Jerry to record singles, including \"Our Song\" and \"That's My Story\". Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time he performed alone, or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on minor record labels including Amy, Big, Hunt, King, Tribute and Madison. Simon used several pseudonyms for these recordings, usually \"Jerry Landis\", but also \"Paul Kane\" and \"True Taylor\".

The album initially flopped."}, {"text": "=== 1960s: Simon & Garfunkel ===In 1965, after the album's release, Simon moved to London and performed in folk clubs. He enjoyed his time in England and said in 1970, \"I had a lot of friends there and a girlfriend. I could play music there. There was no place to play in New York City. They wouldn't have me.\" He was welcomed by England's bohemian folk scene, learned how to finger-pick acoustic guitar from Martin Carthy, and was introduced to English folk music. He recalled, \"I had never heard anything like those old English songs. I was 21, 22, and emotionally open to everything.\" The folk music he heard in England in the mid-sixties became one of his two big influences. He wrote 'Homeward Bound' and 'I am a Rock', and learned Davey Graham's guitar instrumental \"Anji\", which later appeared on Sounds of Silence."}, {"text": "=== 1960s: Simon & Garfunkel ===In England, he produced Jackson C. Frank's first and only album and co-wrote several songs with Bruce Woodley of the Australian pop group the Seekers, including \"I Wish You Could Be Here\", \"Cloudy\" and \"Red Rubber Ball\". Simon also contributed to the Seekers' catalog with \"Someday One Day\", which was released in March 1966, charting around the same time as Simon and Garfunkel's \"Homeward Bound\".

Simon & Garfunkel's producer, Tom Wilson, overdubbed the track with electric guitar, bass guitar and drums and it was released as a single, eventually reaching number 1 on the US pop charts. Wilson did not inform the duo of his plan, and Simon was \"horrified\" when he first heard it. The success of the single drew Simon back to the US to reunite with Garfunkel, and they recorded the albums Sounds of Silence (1966), Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966) and Bookends (1968). Their final album, Bridge over Troubled Water (1970), became at that time the bestselling album of all time."}, {"text": "=== 1960s: Simon & Garfunkel ===Simon & Garfunkel also contributed to the soundtrack of the Mike Nichols film The Graduate (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. While writing \"Mrs. Robinson\", Simon toyed with the title \"Mrs. Roosevelt\". When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, \"Don't be ridiculous! We're making a movie here! It's Mrs. Robinson!\""}, {"text": "=== 1960s: Simon & Garfunkel ===Simon and Garfunkel's relationship became strained and they split in 1970.

He said he had wanted to teach for a while, and hoped to help people avoid some of the mistakes he had made: \"You can teach somebody about writing songs. You can't teach someone how to write a song ... I'd go to a course if the Beatles would talk about how they made records because I'm sure I could learn something.\""}, {"text": "=== 1970\u20131976: Solo and Still Crazy After All These Years ===Simon pursued solo work, reuniting occasionally with Garfunkel for various projects. He gave a solo performance at the Cleveland Arena in April 1972 in a benefit concert for the George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign, and he and Garfunkel reunited in mid-June that year at Madison Square Garden in another political concert for McGovern. Garfunkel joined Simon again on the 1975 Top 10 single \"My Little Town\". Simon wrote this song for Garfunkel, whose solo output Simon felt lacked \"bite\", and it was included on Simon's album Still Crazy After All These Years and Garfunkel's album Breakaway. Contrary to popular belief, the song was not based on Simon's early life in New York City. Simon also provided guitar on Garfunkel's 1973 album Angel Clare, and added backing vocals to the song \"Down in the Willow Garden\"."}, {"text": "=== 1970\u20131976: Solo and Still Crazy After All These Years ===Simon's next album, Paul Simon, was released in January 1972, following his first experiment with world music, the Jamaican-inspired song \"Mother and Child Reunion\", which reached both the American and British Top 5.

Other songs like \"American Tune\", or \"Something So Right\" (a tribute to Simon's first wife Peggy), became part of his repertoire. The album reached number 1 on the Cashbox album charts.

The album was his only number 1 on the Billboard charts to date. The 18th Grammy Awards named it the Album of the Year, and his performance on it the year's Best Male Pop Vocal. The third single from the album, \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\", reached the top spot on the Billboard charts.

This would have been their first new recordings as a duo since their hit single \"My Little Town\" in 1975 and their first album of new material since Bridge over Troubled Water in 1970. Simon ultimately decided to wipe Garfunkel's vocals from the mix, and in 1983, Simon released the album Hearts and Bones as a solo album. This was a polished and confessional album that was eventually viewed as one of his best works, but it achieved the lowest sales of his career. Hearts and Bones included \"The Late Great Johnny Ace\", a song partly about Johnny Ace, an American R&B singer, and partly about John Lennon.

Additional sessions were held in New York. The sessions featured many South African acts, particularly Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and Simon also collaborated with several American artists, singing a duet with Linda Ronstadt in \"Under African Skies\", and playing with Los Lobos in \"All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints\".

Simon denied that he had gone to South Africa to \"take money out of the country\", and stated that he paid the black artists and split royalties with them, and was not paid to play to a white-only audience. The United Nations Anti-Apartheid Committee supported Graceland, as it showcased black South African musicians and offered no support to the South African government, but the African National Congress protested that it was a violation of the boycott. The Congress voted to ban Simon from South Africa and he was added to the United Nations blacklist, from which he was removed in January 1987.

Sessions for the album began in December 1989 in Rio de Janeiro and New York and featured guitarist J.J. Cale, and Brazilian and African musicians. The tone of the album was more introspective and low-key than the upbeat feel of Graceland. Released in October 1990, the album received excellent reviews and sold well, peaking at number 4 in the U.S. and number 1 in the UK. The lead single, \"The Obvious Child\", featuring the Grupo Cultural Olodum, became Simon's last Top 20 hit in the UK and appeared near the bottom of the Billboard Hot 100. Although not as successful as Graceland, The Rhythm of the Saints received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year.

Most of the songs on the album were inspired by the September 11 terrorist attacks, and the Iraq invasion and the war that followed. Simon also took inspiration from having reached the age of 60 in 2001, which he humorously referred to in \"Old\" from You're the One. Surprise was a commercial hit, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200 and number 4 in the UK. Most critics praised the album, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote \"Simon doesn't achieve his comeback by reconnecting with the sound and spirit of his classic work; he has achieved it by being as restless and ambitious as he was at his popular and creative peak.\" The album was supported by the Surprise Tour in 2006."}, {"text": "=== 1999\u20132007: You're the One and Surprise ===In March 2004, Walter Yetnikoff published a book called Howling at the Moon, in which he criticized Simon and his previous business partnership with Columbia Records.

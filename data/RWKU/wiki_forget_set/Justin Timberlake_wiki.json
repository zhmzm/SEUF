By that time, he began listening to rhythm and blues musicians from the 1960s and 70s, such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and he had listening sessions with his father of studio albums by the Eagles and Bob Seger.In 1993 and 1994, he was a Mouseketeer on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and singer Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell.

He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model.The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of NSYNC. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir Out of Sync.

He began including beatboxing in his records near the end of his boyband era and into his emergence as a solo act with Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds. Many of his songs draw from his personal life and relationships, notably \"Cry Me a River\" (about his breakup with Britney Spears). Described by critics as a \"consummate showman\", Timberlake usually plays guitar, piano and keyboard in his shows. The New York Times' editor Katie Rogers highlighted Timberlake's crossover appeal after his performance with Chris Stapleton at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards.Primarily an R&B album, his 2002 debut Justified also includes influence from dance-pop, funk and soul music.

He supported the album with a pair of tours: Legends of the Summer, which he co-headlined with Jay-Z, and The 20/20 Experience World Tour. These tours introduced his backing ensemble, the Tennessee Kids, a 15-piece multi-instrumentalist throwback to big band music."}, {"text": "== Public image ==Timberlake's fashion and style evolution, from \"boy-band synchronized wardrobe days\" to \"a notable source of fashion inspiration to men all over\", has been noticed by the media. As noted by a Billboard editor, \"Since his solo career began with the 2002 release of debut album Justified, Timberlake has honed his unique sense of style\", while citing Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Frank Sinatra as style influences: \"guys who were just really never trying to be that [stylish], they just were that\". According to American fashion designer Tom Ford, who has dressed Timberlake since 2011 and created more than 600 exclusive pieces for The 20/20 Experience World Tour, Timberlake \"has a kind of effortless cool that makes classic menswear tailoring modern\".The New York Times' editor Sia Michel wrote in 2007, \"Since his last tour, for 2002's multiplatinum Justified, he has learned how to project sex-symbol edge\" adding \"he's a rock star who can commit.\" Napster's founder Sean Parker, portrayed by Timberlake in The Social Network, stated \"I don't think I look anything like Timberlake, but it's not so bad being played by a sex symbol.\" In Nielsen Music's U.S. report for 2015, Timberlake led the \"Top 10 Musicians Among Millennials\" list. His high-profile relationships earned him the nickname \"Trousersnake\", a reference to his allegedly big penis. Wax statues of Timberlake are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in New York, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Nashville, Berlin, Amsterdam, and London.

The meme eventually became an annually recurring joke throughout the month of April, which gained the attention of Barack Obama and Timberlake himself. Influenced by the national attention received by Timberlake's selfie inside a voting booth shared on Instagram during the 2016 presidential election, which was at the moment an illegal act, Senator Brian Kelsey of Germantown, Tennessee brought up a bill that would allow taking photos in voting poll stations, with some exceptions against bad procedures.

We hope the courts, and her family make this right and let her live however she wants to live\"."}, {"text": "=== Controversies ===Following the release of Framing Britney Spears, public attention was brought to old comments Timberlake made in 2002 to describe his relationship with Britney Spears following their breakup, with some considering them to contain misogynistic rhetoric. It also led to renewed interest in his participation in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, where he exposed Janet Jackson's breast on live television. Following much public pressure, Timberlake issued a public apology on his Instagram page, writing he \"benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism\" and \"I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again.\" He finished by saying \"I care deeply about the wellbeing of the people I love and have loved. I can do better and I will do better\".Public scrutiny surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII incident was raised when a stylist alleged that the plan was originally for Timberlake to step on the back of Jackson's dress to reveal her butt in a g-string but that he changed the plan to exposing her breast because he wanted a \"reveal\" to  \"one-up\" Britney Spears' and Madonna's kiss at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The claim that Timberlake wanted the breast reveal, however, is contradictory to a statement from Salli Frattini, the producer of the Halftime show, who stated in 2018 that the production team experimented with removing elements of clothing in rehearsal to reveal Jackson's skirt without nudity but that the idea was ultimately nixed. According to Frattini, it was Jackson's team who pitched the idea to Timberlake prior to the show that lead to Jackson's breast being exposed."}, {"text": "== Legacy ==Timberlake has been referred to as the \"President of Pop\" and \"Prince of Pop\" by contemporary journalists.

For Entertainment Weekly his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, \"redefined pop's cutting edge\"; for Vibe it \"pushed boundaries more forcefully\" than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it \"changed the game. [The album] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy.

Christian hip hop artist tobyMac has stated Timberlake's work inspires him, commenting \"he's setting himself up to be a classic, making decisions and moving on them. That's a great place to be.\" In the context of male artists that achieved commercial success after leaving their boy bands, Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone wrote \"Timberlake and Michael Jackson set a high bar for what could be attained by solo success in that they not only scored numerous number-one hits but they also crafted the mold for what it meant to be a male pop star\", while for Variety's Jeremy Blacklow the singer is \"the modern case study\".

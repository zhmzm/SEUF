She was adopted as an infant and named Audrey Faith Perry. She was raised in the nearby town of Star, 20 miles southeast of Jackson. Her adoptive parents, Edna and Ted Perry, raised her with their two biological sons in a devout Christian environment.She began singing at Star Baptist Church at age 3. Hill's vocal talent was apparent early, and she had her first public performance, at a 4-H luncheon, when she was seven. In 1976, a few days before her 9th birthday, she attended a concert by Elvis Presley at the State Fair Coliseum in Jackson, which impressed her deeply. During her teenage years, she became a member of the Steele Family gospel quartet with whom she performed regularly at area churches of all denominations.  At 17, Hill formed a band that played at local rodeos. She graduated from McLaurin Attendance Center in 1986, and briefly attended college at Hinds Junior College (now Hinds Community College) in Raymond, Mississippi. At times, she sang for prisoners at the Hinds County Jail, her song of choice being \"Amazing Grace\".At age 19, she dropped out of college to move to Nashville and pursue her dream of being a country singer. In her early days in Nashville, Hill auditioned to be a backup singer for Reba McEntire, but failed to secure the job. A few years later in 1991, the singer who beat out Hill for the job was killed in a plane crash with 6 other members of Reba's band.After a stint selling T-shirts, Hill became a secretary at a music publishing firm. Hill also landed a job at a local McDonald's restaurant franchise, which she disliked intensely. \"Fries, burgers, cash register\u2013I did it all, I hated it,\" she has said.In 1988, she married music publishing executive Daniel Hill (not to be confused with Canadian musician Dan Hill).A co-worker heard Hill singing to herself one day, and soon the head of her music publishing company was encouraging her to become a demo singer for the firm. She supplemented this work by singing backup vocals for songwriter Gary Burr, who often performed his new songs at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe. During one of those performances, Martha Sharp, an executive from Warner Bros. Records was in the audience, and, impressed with Hill's voice, began the process of signing her to a recording contract.Shortly after the release of her album, she and Daniel Hill divorced in 1994."}, {"text": "=== 1993\u20131997: Country music success ===Faith Hill's debut album was Take Me as I Am (1993); sales were strong, buoyed by the chart success of \"Wild One\". Hill became the first female country singer in 30 years to hold Billboard's number one position for four consecutive weeks when \"Wild One\" managed the feat in 1994. Her version of \"Piece of My Heart\", also went to the top of the country charts in 1994. The album sold a total of 3 million copies. Other singles from the album include \"Take Me as I Am\"."}, {"text": "=== 1993\u20131997: Country music success ===The recording of Hill's second album was delayed by surgery to repair a ruptured blood vessel on her vocal cords. It Matters to Me finally appeared in 1995 and was another success, with the title track becoming her third number-one country single. Several other top 10 singles followed, and more than 3 million copies of the album were sold. The fifth single from the album, \"I Can't Do That Anymore\", was written by Alan Jackson. Other singles from the album include \"You Can't Lose Me\", \"Someone Else's Dream\", and \"Let's Go to Vegas\".

At the time Hill had recently become engaged to her former producer, Scott Hendricks, and McGraw had recently broken an engagement. McGraw and Hill were quickly attracted to each other and began a relationship. After discovering that Hill was pregnant with their first child, the couple married on October 6, 1996. The couple have three daughters together: Gracie Katherine (born 1997), Maggie Elizabeth (born 1998) and Audrey Caroline (born 2001). Since their marriage, Hill and McGraw have endeavored never to be apart for more than three consecutive days.After the release of It Matters to Me, Hill took a three-year break from recording to give herself a rest from four years of touring and to begin a family with McGraw. During her break, she joined forces with her husband for their first duet, \"It's Your Love\". The song stayed at number one for six weeks, and won awards from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association. Hill has remarked that sometimes when they perform the song together, \"it [doesn't] feel like anybody else was really watching.\""}, {"text": "=== 1998\u20132003: Pop music crossover and career breakthrough ===Faith Hill re-entered the music business in 1998 with her third album Faith. The album showcased her progression toward a more mainstream, pop-oriented sound, although it retained a distinct country sound. \"This Kiss\" became a number one country hit, and was the first of her singles to place on the pop charts, peaking at number seven. More than six million copies of the album were sold. The album also had several other hits including another duet with McGraw, \"Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me\", \"Let Me Let Go\" and \"The Secret of Life\".Hill immediately released Breathe in November 1999 following this success; it debuted at the top of the Billboard Country and all genre charts, ahead of albums by Mariah Carey and Savage Garden. Although the album had few overt country sounds, it \"complement[ed] her vocal strengths.\" For the first time, the album consisted solely of songs about love and did not venture into the more somber territory that her previous albums had touched. The title track, \"Breathe\", reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"The Way You Love Me\" hit the top 10 as well, topping out at number six on the charts. The album won Hill three Grammy Awards including Best Country Album, Best Country Collaboration With Vocals for \"Let's Make Love\" featuring Tim McGraw and Best Country Female Vocal Performance for \"Breathe\". It marked a step away from her girl-next-door image, as the videos and promotional pictures all portrayed a much sexier image. Breathe has sold almost 10 million copies worldwide.2000 was a very busy year for Hill. In addition to a successful tour with her husband, Hill was featured in a CBS television special, VH1's Behind the Music, VH1 Divas 2000, and the Lifetime cable channel's Intimate Portrait series. She signed an endorsement deal with CoverGirl makeup, performed at the Academy Awards and the Grammy Awards, appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, and performed the national anthem at Super Bowl XXXIV.

The song also appeared on the pop and country charts. Hill's success on the pop charts disturbed some country music insiders, who questioned whether she was trying to dismiss her country roots and move into the pop genre. Despite the grumbling, Hill won the CMA Female Vocalist of the Year Award, and in her acceptance speech announced, \"I love this business, and I love this industry... and my heart is here.\"In 2001, Hill recorded a song for the Pearl Harbor soundtrack. The track, also titled \"There You'll Be\", which was originally offered to Celine Dion, has since become one of Hill's most critically acclaimed songs. Because of the single's international success, a compilation album There You'll Be: The Best of Faith Hill, was released to international markets. The album featured dance mixes of \"Breathe\" and \"The Way You Love Me\" along with alternate versions of \"Piece of My Heart\" and \"Let Me Let Go\". \"There You'll Be\"  was nominated for a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in a motion picture."}, {"text": "=== 1998\u20132003: Pop music crossover and career breakthrough ===In 2002, Hill released her fifth studio album, Cry. The album \"spotlight[ed] her impressive set of pipes\", and also marked the completion of her \"transformation into a pop diva\", containing few nods to her country roots.

The song was specifically written for her by John Rich (of Big and Rich) and Adam Shoenfield of MuzikMafia, and tells the abbreviated story of her life. Hill recorded two other songs by Rich, \"Sunshine and Summertime\" and \"Like We Never Loved at All\", both of which became successful singles.

For movies and television, she is sometimes asked to colour her hair dark brown or black to make her look more stereotypically Hispanic. Vergara was married at the age of 18 to her high-school sweetheart, Joe Gonzalez. They have a son named Manolo, who was born in Colombia on September 16, 1991. They divorced in 1993.

On May 9, 2011, Vergara's younger brother Julio was deported from the United States to Colombia after being arrested in April that year; Julio also had a longtime drug addiction and previous brushes with the law. Vergara told Parade magazine, \"To see somebody dying over 10 years, little by little, that's the worst punishment. Now he's like another person.\" During her December 2014 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Vergara revealed that she had become a United States citizen after getting a perfect score on her citizenship test.From 2015 to 2017, Vergara was involved in a legal dispute regarding the future of two fertilized embryos produced by in vitro fertilization while she was still in a relationship with Loeb; the embryos were kept in storage in cryopreservation in a medical clinic in California. Following the couple's split in 2014, Loeb filed a lawsuit for custody of the embryos in a California court, but he later dropped that lawsuit when the court demanded that Loeb identify two women who had abortions after he had impregnated them. In December 2016, a right-to-life lawsuit against Vergara was initiated in Louisiana with Vergara's embryos as plaintiffs. The embryos were named \"Emma\" and \"Isabella\" in the lawsuit, and their \"trustee\" was listed as James Charbonnet, a New Orleans resident of no relation to Vergara. The intent of the suit was to give the embryos a chance to further develop using a surrogate carrier, hence to be born, and to benefit from an inheritance trust that had been created for them and is administered by Charbonnet. Loeb had written \"Keeping them frozen forever is tantamount to killing them,\" in a 2015 op-ed in The New York Times. The suit also tried to terminate parental rights of Vergara because by keeping them in cryopreservation in a medical clinic she allegedly abandoned and neglected the embryos. The legal case was novel and took advantage of Louisiana's embryo laws; the state passed a law in 1986 that declares embryos to be \"juridical persons\", giving embryos the right to sue or be sued. In August 2017, a Louisiana judge dismissed the case on the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction over the embryos, which were conceived in California."}, {"text": "=== Theatre ===Chicago as Matron \"Mama\" Morton (2009)"}, {"text": "== Awards and nominations ==In 2014, Vergara was ranked as the 32nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes; her position was 38 the previous year."}, {"text": "== External links ==Official website"}, {"text": "== External links ==Sof\u00eda Vergara at IMDb"}, {"text": "== External links ==Sof\u00eda Vergara at AllMovie"}, {"text": "== External links ==Sof\u00eda Vergara at Fashion Model Directory"}]

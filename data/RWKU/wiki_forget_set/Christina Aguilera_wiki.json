In December, she began her second residency, Christina Aguilera at Voltaire, at The Venetian Las Vegas."}, {"text": "=== Influences ===Aguilera has named Etta James as a \"role model\", and said \"At Last\" made a major impression on her. She later stated, \"I'll still be as raunchy as I wanna be, and I'll have [Etta]'s memory to back me up. She's what I want to be someday\". As a young girl, The Sound of Music (1959) and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, became her early references to sing and perform, in addition to broadening her interest on Broadway. Aguilera's other major influences include Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald. She has also cited rock bands as an influence, specifically the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, and Radiohead.Aguilera was also influenced by Latin music. She later recalled singing her first songs in Spanish during childhood, saying: \"I grew up hearing [Spanish] being spoken in my household [and] hearing a lot of Julio Iglesias on the record player\". Some of her other inspirations in Latin music include Chavela Vargas, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, and younger artists such Rosal\u00eda. As a performer, Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as major inspirations for being \"positive female artists [who] aren't afraid to take chances, be daring, experimental and sexy\". Cher also encouraged her to being a performer and \"a woman who has the guts to do [everything]\".Aguilera's childhood visits to records stores moulded her taste and led to an appreciation for blues and soul music, which she called \"music that really had heart\". Her music has also paid homage to many artists from this genre, including Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, and Otis Redding. Her album Back to Basics (2006) features inspirations of musicians from the early 20th century. As she later commented: \"I was just so drawn to that [kind of music] ... [It] has so much pain, so much beauty of raw emotion and passion\". Her other influences in the genre was added for Liberation (2018), including Michael Jackson in \"Maria\" and Janis Joplin in \"Sick of Sittin'\".Outside of the music industry, Aguilera was inspired by actresses from the Old Hollywood. She later stated, \"I'm fascinated with the golden age of film. I wanted to capture the authenticity of the glam era\", after which she cited examples such as Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo, Veronica Lake, and the pin-up models. Her \"Tilt Ya Head Back\" music video also recreated Monroe's signature look, while the video for \"Your Body\" includes a directly reference to Lucille Ball. The video for \"Ain't No Other Man\" presented Aguilera under the alter ego Baby Jane, which was inspired by Bette Davis's character in psychological horror film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). Her other inspirations mostly came from contemporary art, including works by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Banksy."}, {"text": "=== Voice ===Critics have described Aguilera as a soprano, possessing a four-octave vocal range. She is also able to perform the whistle register. Maura Johnston, a journalist with Slate, called Aguilera's voice \"an instrument that despite its ability to leap octaves has a low-end grounding similar to that possessed by opera singers\". The Boston Globe columnist Joan Anderman highlighted her vocal versatility: \"[She] is a real singer ... blessed with the sort of breathtaking elasticity, golden tones, and sheer power that separate the divas from the dabblers\". In addition to sustain high notes, Aguilera is recognized for making use of the melismatic technique. Jon Pareles from The New York Times emphasized that \"she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, and scalloping melismas\". Ron Fair\u2014A&R executive from RCA Records\u2014was impressed by her \"perfect intonation\", and concluded: \"She's got the pipes to be the next Barbra Streisand or C\u00e9line Dion\".Aguilera's singing technique also yielded comparisons to other singers. Journalist David Browne suggested that, alongside Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, she \"forms the team of the main proponents\" of the melismatic technique. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post also noticed similarities with both artists: \"She has a genuinely powerful voice that's evoked comparisons [to them], though it for the most part avoids those singers' ornamental mannerisms\". The New Yorker columnist Sasha Frere-Jones also credited the technique by making her become \"a serious singer without needing to reincarnate the Sarah Vaughan\". Songwriter  Steve Kipner praises Aguilera's vocal dexterity, including her ability to \"internalize[d] all the riffs from Chaka Khan\". Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote that she possesses a \"voice purely powerful as that of Etta James [...] and she's moving toward the expressiveness of Gladys Knight, if not Aretha Franklin\". Powers also associated her vocal ability with Donna Summer when she performs records influenced by rhythm and blues.Aguilera, however, has also been criticized for the excessive use of melisma, as well for oversinging during her concerts shows. The Huffington Post columnist John Eskow called her as \"the main proponent of oversouling\". Eskow recognizes Aguilera's voice as a \"great instrument\", although she \"[doesn't] seem to know when to stop\" with the use of \"gratuitous and confected melisma\". Lucy Davies, music critic from BBC Music, raved about her \"stunning voice\", but offered that \"she could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'ye-e-eeeh, woah' in her songs\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman credits Aguilera's tendency to oversinging as an influence of Mariah Carey, noting \"her slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song\". Alexa Tietjen from VH1 acknowledged that Aguilera \"does tend to take it to the extreme at times [...] but her vocal prowess is what's gotten her so far. Love them or hate them, the riffs are a part of who she is as performer\"."}, {"text": "=== Musical style ===Aguilera's discography is generally categorized as pop, contemporary R&B, soul, and hip-hop. According to critics, she has also experimented with other musical genres in her works. In a 2008 interview, she explained that she is \"always inspired by new things\" in music and enjoys \"experimenting with [her] voice\". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian considered the \"boldness in [continually] reinventing\" her music as \"one of her most impressive facets\" as an artist. Initially established as a bubblegum pop singer, she mixed teen pop and dance-pop on her first records, Christina Aguilera (1999) and Mi Reflejo (2000), with the latter also taking inspiration from numerous genres in Latin music.Moving away from the teen niche, Aguilera's post-2000 material mainly incorporated R&B and hip-hop. Listed as an executive producer on Stripped (2002), she mixed both genres with Latin pop, rock, neo-soul, gospel, among others, while Back to Basics (2006) was described as a \"throwback with elements of old-school genres combined with a modern-day twist [and] hard-hitting beats\". She continued merging R&B with other musical styles on Burlesque (2010), as well on Liberation (2018), which also features hip-hop, soul and blues elements.The show tune \"Lady Marmalade\" is noted as Aguilera's first musical transformation. Referred to as \"too urban\" by RCA Records executives, the song transitioned her music \"from teen pop to a more mature sound\". Despite the renewal in her repertoire, Aguilera continued producing power ballads\u2014which became a signature in her discography\u2014in between her uptempo material. Kelefa Sanneh, music critic from The New York Times, observed the continuous modification in her music, in addition to highlighting her \"decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely\". Her notable sonically drastic ventures include the subversive futurepop on Bionic (2010), electropop club on Lotus (2012), and Mexican ranchera numbers on Aguilera (2022)."}, {"text": "=== Lyrical themes ===Aguilera's music has been the subject of analysis. Critics have acknowledged domestic violence experienced during childhood as one of the main topics in her music. Mary Anne Donovan, author of Christina Aguilera: A Biography (2010), noted that she \"channeled her fear and sadness away from the abuse in her family to instead create the music that became her art and her livelihood\". It also influenced Aguilera's transition to adulthood and impacted many of her songs, whose lyrics reference female empowerment. In a 2006 interview, she commented: \"I feel a responsibility to share some of these things that aren\u2019t kind of the brighter sides of my life. People [who] can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance\".Aguilera has also often defended the sex-positive movement and denounced social double standards in her music. Reviewing Stripped (2002), Sophie Wilkinson from Vice opined that its music \"explores nuanced articulations of sexual desires and fears while highlighting the social double standards\", in addition to giving \"any woman the confidence to take charge of her sexuality and ownership of her body\". Jennifer K. Armstrong, author of Sexy Feminism: A Girl's Guide to Love, Success, and Style (2013), opined that her music has \"reject[ed] the double standards set forth by sexism and patriarchy\".Chin Wai Wong from Hollins University also observed topics such as romance, introspection of vulnerability, gratitude for support, and sexual liberation in Aguilera's music, representing \"multi-dimensional aspects of life [and] different social responsibilities a woman experiences\". While critics noted the feminist message in her works, Aguilera was acknowledged for her \"refusal to sanitize her own sexuality to meet either the norms of mainstream gender politics or mainline Feminism's resistance\". The Guardian journalist Hermione Hoby opined that she \"incites a sisterly spirit of collaboration [and] is not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself\". Other themes addressed in her lyrics include self-respect, body image, and LGBT rights, in addition to \"fighting for creative freedom and gender equality\"."}, {"text": "=== Public image ===Publications have called Aguilera a pop icon, a triple threat entertainer and has often been labeled a diva for her stardom and persona. Bustle writer James Tison noted comparisons to Mariah Carey adding that \"[Aguilera] has mastered being a diva in the best way possible\". Her vocal abilities often also distinguished her from her peers. Her fan-base is named the \"Fighters\" drawing inspiration from her 2003 single \"Fighter\". She is one of the most popular musicians on Twitter with approximately 17 million followers, and was one of the most searched artists in the world in 2002, 2004, and 2010 through Google.

Search.Aguilera is also recognized as a gay icon; in 2019, she was awarded by the Human Rights Campaign for using her \"platform to share a message of hope and inspiration to those who have been marginalized [...] bringing greater visibility to the LGBTQ community\". Her 2002 song \"Beautiful\" has been called an anthem for the LGBT community, with UK LGBT rights charity Stonewall naming it the most empowering song of the decade for lesbian, gay and bisexual people and for having \"inspired millions of young people around the world\". In 2023, Aguilera was honored for her LGBTQ allyship and for advocating for the queer community at the Stonewall National Monument.Aguilera's style and fashion has attracted significant media attention throughout her career, and she has been named a fashion icon. Jon Caramanica, journalist from The New York Times, concluded that \"Aguilera will be remembered for her glamour and her scandalous take on femme-pop\", while Janelle Okwodu from Vogue noted that she \"has never been afraid to take a fashion risk [and] has filled her videos with jaw-dropping styles and risqu\u00e9 runway looks\". Following her appearance at New York Fashion Week in 2018, Dazed named her one of the most stylish people of the year. Aguilera's influence on fashion has been noted by several publications. Samantha Sutton of InStyle noted Aguilera's influence on the rising fashion trends of 2021. Writing for Vogue in 2022, Christian Allaire said that Aguilera was \"ahead of her time\" when it came to her 2002 image.Since the beginning of her career, Aguilera has attracted criticism for her revealing clothes, and has been called a sex symbol. In an interview with MTV News, Debbie Gibson accused her of \"influencing girls out there wearing less and less\", considering that \"she lives and breathes the sexual image\". In response to negative comments, Aguilera stated: \"Just because I have a certain image, everyone wants me to be this role model. But nobody is perfect, and nobody can live up to that\". VH1, included in the list of the sexiest entertainment artists in 2002 and 2013; in publications from FHM and Complex, she received similar honors in 2004 and 2012, respectively.

Stereogum writer Tom Breihan noted that she originally \"thought of herself primarily as a [...] young Mariah Carey-type\", but was instead marketed as a bubblegum pop teen idol due to the genre's popularity in the late 1990s, following the success of Britney Spears's debut album. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly felt that Aguilera was \"a good girl pretending to be bad\" when compared to Spears' image. In contrast, Christopher J. Farley of Time considered her a more impressive artist than Spears. Aguilera's vocals set her apart from her bubblegum pop peers.Aguilera departed from the teen idol image with the release of Stripped in 2002, by dyeing her hair black, getting body piercings, and posing nude for several publications. This was attributed to her provocative and extravagant alter ego named Xtina. Serving as the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, Aguilera opened the show dressed as a nun, accompanied by a choir singing the lead single from Stripped, \"Dirrty\", before showing off a more revealing outfit. While analyzing her new visual, Vice and Rolling Stone magazines wrote that her new clothes echoed as if she were participating in the Girls Gone Wild franchise. In a review of her persona, author Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic opined that Aguilera reached \"maturity with transparent sexuality and pounding sounds of nightclubs\". Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Adam White was more positive about her image and recognized that her \"embracing of an overtly sexual image in the wake of adolescent stardom was a tried and tested route to adult success\".For the release of Back to Basics in 2006, Aguilera adopted a new persona named Baby Jane, named after Bette Davis's character in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). The image drew inspiration from actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, such as Marilyn Monroe, to go with the album's 1920s\u20131950s musical direction. In 2008, she adopted a futuristic image, which drew comparisons to the image of then-newcomer, Lady Gaga. In 2012, she drew criticism over her weight gain from several publications; the following year, she received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss. In March 2018, Aguilera appeared on the cover of the spring 2018 issue of Paper, titled \"Transformation\". Photographed by Zoey Grossman, the images featured Aguilera with minimal makeup and no photographic manipulation, debuting her freckles. Her appearance in the pictures received significant media attention and widespread praise. This led to other celebrities who had posed similarly receiving attention. Starting in 2021, Aguilera began showing off a red-haired look for the promotion of her ninth studio album, Aguilera (2022)."}, {"text": "=== Legacy ===Various music journalists and authors have noted Aguilera's legacy in the entertainment industry and deemed her as one of the greatest artists in pop music.

Considered one of the greatest artists of the 2000s, she has been classified between the main references of the Millennials; writing for Vice magazine, Wanna Thompson analyzed her impact in the turn of the century, stating that alongside Britney Spears, \"Aguilera dominated mainstream pop-related discussions. [Her] perfectly packaged music and looks appealed to tweens and teens who wanted to be like the pretty, chart-topping pop stars plastered everywhere\". The commercial success of her first projects as a bubblegum pop singer caused an effect that influenced record labels to invest in new artists who attracted the same youthful appeal, catapulting names like Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore.Critics also highlighted the impact of her work in popular culture; while Stripped (2002) was called \"the blueprint for divas making the transition from teen idol to adult pop star\", Aguilera is credited for \"paving the way for a generation of pop singers\". Jeff Benjamin from Billboard stated that the album explored a \"process of self-identification and declaration still influencing today's mainstream scene\", in addition to \"how of today's biggest pop stars have followed a similar path, exploring and incorporating these strategies into their careers\". In 2007, her self-titled debut album was added to the definitive list from Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, being recognized as one of the \"history's most influential and popular albums\".

Lamar Dawson, columnist from The Huffington Post, praised her feminist efforts in the music industry and recognized that \"while Christina isn't the first pop star to place feminist rhetoric into pop culture, she led the charge at the beginning of the 21st century of influencing the next generation of impressionable teens who were too young for Janet [Jackson] and Madonna's curriculum\". Gerrick D. Kennedy from Los Angeles Times shared the same point of view and stated that \"for a generation who hit puberty during the great 2000 pop explosion, Aguilera was an essential voice with music that tackled self-empowerment, feminism, sex and domestic violence \u2014 subject matter her contemporaries were shying away from\". Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, co-founder of The Vagenda, opined that the provocative dance routines in Aguilera's music videos were \"empowering\", as she has been referred to as the forerunner of the slutdrop dance style.Aguilera's videography impact was also analysed by music critics. While \"Dirrty\" (2002) has been described as \"one of the most controversial videos in pop music history\", and one of the greatest music videos of all time, Issy Beech from i-D recognized that the audiovisual work \"paved a path for videos like \"Anaconda\" and \"Wrecking Ball\" [...] paved the way for open sexuality from women in pop\". In the video for \"Beautiful\" (2002), the highlight scene of a gay kiss has been considered one of the most important moments for LGBT culture, in addition to start Aguilera's image as a gay icon. Both works was elected as one of the greatest music videos of the 21st century by editors from Billboard, while she was named one of the greatest women of the video era according to VH1.

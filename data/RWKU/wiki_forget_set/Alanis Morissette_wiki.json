She is known for her mezzo-soprano voice and songwriting. Morissette began her music career in Canada in the early 1990s with two dance-pop albums. In 1995, she released Jagged Little Pill, an alternative rock-oriented album with elements of post-grunge. This album sold more than 33 million copies globally, propelling her to become a cultural phenomenon. It earned her the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1996 and was adapted into a rock musical of the same name in 2017. The musical earned fifteen Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical. Additionally, the album was listed in Rolling Stone's 2003 and 2020 editions of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" guide. The lead single, \"You Oughta Know\", was also included at #103 in their \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\"."}, {"text": "Morissette followed up with a highly anticipated, more experimental, critically acclaimed album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which was released in 1998. Under Rug Swept (2002) marked the first time Morissette being the sole producer of the whole album. Her first three internationally released studio albums topped the Billboard 200 albums chart and the rest of her albums peaked within Top 20. Taking further creative control and production duties, Morissette continued her career with subsequent studio albums, including So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavors of Entanglement (2008), Havoc and Bright Lights (2012), and Such Pretty Forks in the Road (2020). Her latest album, The Storm Before the Calm, featuring ambient music, was released in 2022."}, {"text": "Morissette's singles, including \"You Oughta Know\", \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", \"Head Over Feet\", \"Uninvited\", \"Thank U\", and \"Hands Clean\", reached top 40 in the major charts around the world. She boasts ten top-40 songs in the UK, three top-10 hits in the US and Australia, and twelve top-10 tracks in her native Canada.

She has two brothers: her older brother Chad is a business entrepreneur, and her twin brother (12 minutes older) Wade Morissette is a musician. Her father is of French and Irish descent, and her mother has Hungarian and Jewish ancestry. On an episode of Finding Your Roots in 2024, she learned for the first time that her maternal grandfather had escaped the Holocaust in Hungary and had spent years trying to find his two brothers. Morissette didn't learn of her Jewish heritage until her late 20s. Her parents had never shared her maternal Jewish heritage because of the generational trauma. Her parents were teachers in a military school and due to their work often had to move. Between the ages of three and six she lived with her parents in Lahr (Black Forest), West Germany."}, {"text": "== Early life ==When she was six years old, she returned to Ottawa and started to play the piano. In 1981, at the age of seven, she began taking dance lessons. Morissette had a Catholic upbringing. She attended Holy Family Catholic School for elementary school and Immaculata High School for Grades 7 and 8 before graduating from high school at Glebe Collegiate Institute. She appeared on the children's television sketch comedy You Can't Do That on Television for five episodes when she was in junior high school.

Morissette co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, Leslie Howe. The dance-pop album went platinum, and its first single, \"Too Hot\", reached the top 20 on the RPM singles chart. Subsequent singles \"Walk Away\" and \"Feel Your Love\" reached the top 40. Morissette's popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the Debbie Gibson of Canada; comparisons to Tiffany were also common. During the same period, she was a concert opening act for rapper Vanilla Ice. Morissette was nominated for three 1992 Juno Awards: Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year (which she won), Single of the Year and Best Dance Recording (both for \"Too Hot\")."}, {"text": "=== 1987\u20131992: Alanis and Now Is the Time ===In 1992, she released her second album, Now Is the Time, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than Alanis and contained more thoughtful lyrics. Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge C\u00f4t\u00e9. She said of the album, \"People could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it... people will like your next album if it's a kick-ass one.\" As with Alanis, Now Is the Time was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles\u2014\"An Emotion Away\", the minor adult contemporary hit \"No Apologies\" as well as \"(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time\".

Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her \"spectacular voice\", her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living at home with her parents. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people. After graduating from high school, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto. Her publisher funded part of her development and when she met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, he believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio. The two wrote and recorded Morissette's first internationally released album, Jagged Little Pill, and by the spring of 1995, she had signed a deal with Maverick Records.

She was criticized for collaborating with producer and supposed image-maker Ballard, and her previous disco pop albums also proved a hindrance for her respectability. Morissette and the album won six Juno Awards in 1996: Album of the Year, Single of the Year (\"You Oughta Know\"), Female Vocalist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Best Rock Album. At the 16th Brit Awards she won Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act.

Rather than perform that song at the ceremony, she performed Your House instead, which is homage to Joni Mitchell.  The song was also nominated for two 1997 Grammy Awards\u2014Record of the Year and Best Music Video, Short Form\u2014and won Single of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards, where Morissette also won Songwriter of the Year and the International Achievement Award."}, {"text": "=== 1993\u20131997: Jagged Little Pill ===Following the album release in 1995, Morissette embarked on an 18-month world tour in support of Jagged Little Pill, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. Taylor Hawkins, who later joined the Foo Fighters, was the tour's drummer and Radiohead joined as the opening act in the summer of 1996.

The wordy, personal lyrics on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie alienated many fans, and after the album sold considerably less than Jagged Little Pill (1995), many labelled it an example of the sophomore jinx. It received positive reviews, including a four-star review from Rolling Stone. In Canada, it won the Juno Award for Best Album and was certified four times platinum. \"Thank U\", the album's only major international hit single, was released in October 1998 and was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance; the music video, which featured Morissette nude, generated mild controversy.

The same year, she released the live acoustic album Alanis Unplugged, which was recorded during her appearance on the television show MTV Unplugged. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including \"King of Pain\" (a cover of The Police song) and \"No Pressure over Cappuccino\", which Morissette wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie track \"That I Would Be Good\", released as a single, became a minor hit on hot adult contemporary radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song \"Are You Still Mad\" on the charity album Live in the X Lounge II. For her live rendition of \"So Pure\" at Woodstock '99, she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards.

Morissette released her sixth studio album, So-Called Chaos, in May 2004. She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with Tim Thorney and pop music producer John Shanks. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette's lowest seller in the U.S. The lead single, \"Everything\", achieved major success on Adult Top 40 radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. Hot 100. Because the first line of the song includes the word \"asshole\", American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word \"nightmare\" instead. Unhappy that U.S. radio networks had required her to change a word in the song, Canadian radio played the unaltered version, with Morissette stating at the 2004 Juno Awards in Canada: \"Well, I am overjoyed to be back in my homeland, the true North, strong and censor-free.\" Two other singles, \"Out Is Through\" and \"Eight Easy Steps\", fared considerably worse, although a dance mix of \"Eight Easy Steps\" was a U.S. club hit.

She is the only child of Rosellen (n\u00e9e Greenfield), a nursery school teacher, and Arthur Gellar, a garment worker. Both of her parents are Jewish, though Gellar's family also had a Christmas tree during her childhood. In 1984, when she was seven, her parents divorced and she was raised by her mother on Manhattan's Upper East Side. While growing up, she lost contact with her father, from whom she remained estranged until his death in 2001. She once described him as \"non-existent\", and stated: \"My father, you can just say, is not in the picture. I'm not being deliberately evasive about him, it's just that there's so little to say.\" Gellar was a competitive figure skater, once finishing in third place at a New York State regional competition, as well as having a black belt in taekwondo.With her single mother working \"just above the poverty line\", Gellar received a partial scholarship to study at the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, where she experienced bullying. She remarked: \"I was different and that's the one thing you can't be at school, because you're ostracised. I didn't have the money these kids had\". As a working child actress, she was not present in class for a considerable amount of time, and recalled having \"more absences in the first month than you're supposed to have for an entire year\". She then briefly attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, but dropped out due to acting obligations. Gellar graduated from the Professional Children's School in 1994 as a \"straight A\" student with a 4.0 grade average. As she spent significant time working on All My Children while \"trying to graduate\", the majority of her senior year was completed through guided study."}, {"text": "=== 1980s ===At the age of four, Gellar was spotted by an agent in a restaurant in Upper Manhattan. Two weeks later, she auditioned for a part in the television film An Invasion of Privacy. At the audition, she read both her own lines and those of Valerie Harper, impressing the directors enough to cast her in the role. The film aired on CBS in January 1983.While growing up, Gellar appeared in numerous television commercials for such brands as Shake 'n Bake, Avon, and Burger King. A 1982 television spot, in which she claimed Burger King made larger and better tasting  burgers than competitor McDonald's, was  arguably the first attack ad introduced in the fast food industry. Executives at McDonald's parent company were so enraged that they sued all parties involved, naming Gellar and reportedly banning her from eating at the food chain. In a 2004 interview, she recalled: \"I wasn't allowed to eat there. It was tough because, when you're a little kid, McDonald's is where all your friends have their birthday parties, so I missed out on a lot of apple pies.\" She also worked as a model for Wilhelmina.During the 1980s, Gellar played minor roles in the films Over the Brooklyn Bridge (1984), Crossroads (1986), and Funny Farm (1988), though her scenes in the latter two were cut. She obtained a larger role as the daughter of a prostitute in the B thriller High Stakes (1989). Gellar appeared in a safety skit during the November 11, 1985 episode of  Late Night with David Letterman, and guest starred in various television series, such as Spenser: For Hire and Crossbow.

In 1991, she was cast as a young Jacqueline Bouvier in A Woman Named Jackie. The miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series. Gellar obtained her first leading role, as a mayor's manipulative daughter, in the 1992 syndicated teen serial Swans Crossing, which chronicled the lives of a group of wealthy teenagers. She felt that playing a \"villainous\" character gave her the call for \"better and more varied acting skills\", while the gig's weekly payment proved a financial aid for Gellar and her mother. The series ran for a 65-episode season and earned her two Young Artist Award nominations for Best Young Actress.Gellar made her debut on the ABC soap opera All My Children in 1993, playing Kendall Hart, the long-lost teenage daughter of character Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). As she got the role, Gellar was complimented as having the acting talent and the \"forceful personality\" needed to go up against Lucci's experience; Kendall was supposed to be like a younger version of Erica. Her stint on the show was successful as \"longtime fans of the soap saw her as the second coming of Erica\". Writers showcased her more after her initial reception and she became a household name to the soap opera medium. In 1995, at the age of eighteen, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the role. The same year, Gellar left the show and moved to Los Angeles to pursue other acting opportunities. She next played a spoiled adolescent in the Walt Disney television film Beverly Hills Family Robinson, which aired on ABC in January 1997."}, {"text": "=== 1990s ===After reading the script for Joss Whedon's television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which follows Buffy Summers, a teenager burdened with the responsibility of fighting occult foes and supernatural occurrences, Gellar screen tested for the role of Cordelia Chase. Whedon then asked her to come back in and audition for the title role. The show premiered in March 1997, to widespread critical and popular acclaim. Gellar's Buffy, created to subvert the stereotypical female horror movie victim, was described by Entertainment Weekly as one of the 100 greatest female characters in US television. Buffy ran for seven seasons and 144 episodes, and during its broadcast, earned Gellar five Teen Choice Awards, the Saturn Award for Best Genre Television Actress and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama. She sang during the series' musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\", which spawned an original cast album, released in 2002.During the early airing of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar made her first major film appearances in two successful slasher films. In  I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), she took on the role of ill-fated beauty queen Helen Shivers. Washington Post found the cast to be \"solid\", in what San Francisco Chronicle described as a \"competent but uninspired\" film. Budgeted at US$17 million, the film made US$125 million globally. For her part, Gellar earned a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress \u2013 Horror and a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance. In Scream 2 (1997), Gellar played a likewise ill-fated vain character, this time that of  Sorority sister Cici Cooper. She filmed her scenes in between shots of Buffy and had only recently finished work on I Know What You Did Last Summer. Despite the hectic scheduling, she agreed to perform in Scream 2 without having read the script, on the basis of the success of the first film. Scream 2 grossed over US$172 million worldwide.In January 1998, Gellar hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time. She returned as a host in May 1999 and October 2002, and made two cameo appearances in May 2000, including one in which she introduced Britney Spears' performance of \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\". In 1998, she also provided her voice for the Gwendy Doll in Small Soldiers, and for the character of Marie in the King of the Hill episode \"And They Call It Bobby Love\". Gellar's cameo as a girl sitting in the high school cafeteria in the sleeper hit She's All That (1999) was soon followed by her first top-billing film role, as a struggling restaurant owner, in the romantic comedy Simply Irresistible (1999). The film received negative reviews and flopped at the box office, but Roger Ebert found her to be \"lovely\" in what he described as an \"old-fashioned\" comedy.In Roger Kumble's Cruel Intentions (1999), a modern-day retelling of Les Liaisons dangereuses, Gellar portrayed Kathryn Merteuil, a brunette cocaine addict with an appetite for manipulating people. In his review for the film, Ebert felt that she is \"effective as a bright girl who knows exactly how to use her act as a tramp\", and in an interview with Chicago Tribune, Kumble described her as \"the most professional actor I ever worked with\". The film was a hit at the box office, grossing US$75 million worldwide, and went on to become a cult classic. Gellar and co-star Selma Blair obtained the Best Kiss award at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. In Angel, a spin-off series of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar reprised her titular role for a three-episode arc, starting in 1999."}, {"text": "=== 2000s ===In 2000, Gellar appeared as a film studio executive in the HBO series Sex and the City episode \"Escape from New York\". Her next film, James Toback's independent drama Harvard Man (2001), in which she starred as the \"sharp and shrewd\" daughter of a mobster, helped her shed her good girl image, along with Cruel Intentions, according to Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. In 2002, Gellar portrayed Daphne Blake in the live action\u2013comedy Scooby-Doo. For the production, she trained with a Hong Kong wire team, and commuted between Queensland and California every two weeks due to her simultaneous commitment to Buffy. Despite negative reviews, A. O. Scott of The New York Times felt that her performance added \"a snarl of Powerpuff feminism to her character's ditzy stereotype\", and with a global gross of US$275 million, Scooby-Doo emerged as Gellar's most widely seen film to date. Her role earned her the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress \u2013 Comedy. With  Jack Black, she hosted the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, which attracted 7.1 million viewers on its June 6 broadcast, achieving the show's highest rating ever at the time.During her growing film career, Gellar continued to work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but she decided to leave the series after the seventh season. When asked why, she explained, \"This isn't about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater \u2013it's more of a personal decision. I need a rest.\" In her feature in Esquire magazine, Gellar expressed her pride for her work on Buffy, \"I truly believe that it is one of the greatest shows of all time and it will go down in history as that. And I don't feel that that is a cocky statement. We changed the way that people looked at television.\"After the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar reprised the role of Daphne in Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004). Like the first film, Scooby-Doo 2 was a commercial success despite a negative critical response. In Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge (2004), she portrayed  Karen Davis, an exchange student in Tokyo who becomes exposed to a supernatural curse.

Drawn to the \"batshit ambitious\" ideas for the film, she accepted the role before she even read the script. Southland Tales polarised critics upon its debut at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and found a limited audience in theaters. However, J. Hoberman for Village Voice remarked that the director contrived a \"memorable\" comic performance from Gellar, while the film gathered a cult following in subsequent years. In 2006, Gellar briefly reprised the role of Karen in the sequel The Grudge 2, and starred in Asif Kapadia's psychological thriller The Return, as a businesswoman haunted by memories of her childhood and the mysterious death of a young woman. The Return was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only US$11 million. Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times called it a \"career stagnation\".In 2007, Gellar voiced Ella and April O'Neil in Happily N'Ever After and TMNT, respectively. She starred in the romantic comedy Suburban Girl and the drama The Air I Breathe, both of which were screened at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and released in January 2008. In Suburban Girl, she took on the role of a New York City editor and the love interest of a much older businessman (Alec Baldwin). In The Air I Breathe, Gellar portrayed an up-and-coming pop singer. The New York Times described the latter as a \"gangster movie with delusions of grandeur\", while DVD Talk noted that \"her character here has the deepest emotional arc, and she hits all the right notes.\"The psychological thriller Possession, in which Gellar starred as a lawyer whose life is thrown into chaos after a car accident sends her husband and brother-in-law into comas, had a range of release dates in the United States between 2008 and 2009, due to financial problems at Yari Film Group. The film ultimately went to DVD in March 2010. In  Veronika Decides to Die, Gellar starred as a young depressed woman who rediscovers the joy in life when she finds out that she only has days to live following a suicide attempt. Following theatrical runs abroad, the film was released domestically through VOD in January 2015.

Gellar has stated that part of her decision to return to television was because it allowed her to both work and raise her family. Despite a large fan base, the series received mixed reviews, and was canceled after the first season. For her portrayal, she received several award nominations, including one for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Television Actress \u2013 Drama.In September 2011, Gellar returned as a guest star on All My Children before the show's ending but not as Kendall Hart; she portrayed a patient at Pine Valley Hospital who tells Maria Santos that she is \"Erica Kane's daughter\", and states that she saw vampires before they became trendy\u2014a reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

She obtained the part of an advertising director who runs an agency with her father. Digital Spy felt that Williams \"shares a warm, genuine chemistry with his on-screen offspring Gellar,\" as part of a mixed critical response. The series was canceled after one season, but earned Gellar the People's Choice Award for Favorite Actress in a New Television Series.Following the conclusion of The Crazy Ones and the death of Williams, Gellar took another sabbatical from screen acting, stating that she had \"been working [her] entire life\" and \"needed that break\" to focus on raising her children.

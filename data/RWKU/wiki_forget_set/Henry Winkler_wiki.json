By 1939, rising hostilities against Jews led his father to conclude that it was time to leave Germany. He arranged to take his wife on a six-week business trip to the United States. Although Winkler's Uncle Helmut was supposed to join them, at the last minute he decided to leave at a later date, and was eventually murdered during the Holocaust.

He has an older sister named Beatrice.Although his family did not keep kosher, Winkler was raised in the traditions of Conservative Judaism. During his childhood, Winkler and his family spent their summers at Lake Mahopac, New York, and as a teenager he was a water skiing instructor at Blue Mountain camps.While growing up, Winkler had a difficult relationship with his father, who wanted him to continue the family business. When his father grew frustrated with Winkler's focus on acting, he would ask his son why he had brought the business over from Germany to the United States. Winkler would respond: \"Besides being chased by the Nazis, Dad, was there a bigger reason than that?\""}, {"text": "==== Difficulties in school ====Winkler first attended P.S. 87 on West 78th Street, Manhattan, and then the McBurney School on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Although he was \"outgoing\" and \"the class comedian\" in school, he also lived in a state of \"constant anxiety\" over his struggles with schoolwork. His parents were perpetually frustrated by his poor grades, referred to him as \"dummer Hund\" (dumb dog), and repeatedly punished him for his inability to excel in school. Winkler has said that this time period was \"excruciating\" as his \"self-image was almost nonexistent.\" In addition, his consistently poor academic performance made it difficult to be involved in the theater, as he was \"grounded most of my high school career,\" and was almost never academically eligible. However, he did manage to appear in two theatrical productions: Billy Budd when he was in the eighth grade and Of Thee I Sing in the eleventh grade.Although Winkler graduated from the McBurney School in 1963, he was not allowed to attend graduation, as he had to repeat geometry for the fourth time during summer school.

He was also a member of the Alpha Pi Theta fraternity, and appeared in Emerson's production of Peer Gynt as the title character. Winkler later recalled that he had nearly failed his first and second years but managed to stay for four years and graduated in 1967. In 1978, Emerson awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)."}, {"text": "=== 1967\u20131970: Yale School of Drama ===During his senior year at Emerson, Winkler decided to audition for the Yale School of Drama. Although his then-undiagnosed dyslexia led to his forgetting the Shakespearean monologue he was supposed to perform, forcing him to improvise, Winkler was still admitted to the M.F.A. program in 1967.He appeared in They Told Me That You Came This Way, Any Day Now, Any Day Now, and The Bacchae (as a member of the chorus). During the summers, he and his Yale classmates stayed in New Haven, and opened a summer stock theater called the New Haven Free Theater. They performed various plays including Woyzeck, where he portrayed the title role, and Just Add Water for improv night. He also performed in the political piece, The American Pig at the Joseph Papp Public Theater for the New York Shakespeare Festival in New York City, with classmates James Keach, James Naughton, and Jill Eikenberry. In addition, he also appeared in a number of Yale Repertory Theatre productions while still a student, including, The Government Inspector, The Rhesus Umbrella, Don Juan, Endgame, and The Physicists. He also appeared in Sweeney Agonistes and Hughie. Winkler would later credit his time at Yale as critical to his future success.Out of his original cohort of 25 actors at Yale, Winkler was one of 11 who graduated when he received his MFA in 1970.

Three weeks into rehearsals, director Alan Schneider fired him as Winkler had been hired to fill the space until the actor that Schneider really wanted was available. At the time, Winkler was certain that because he had been fired, he would never be hired as an actor again.Winkler moved back to New York, and began to audition for plays, movies, and commercials. He was able to earn a living through performing in commercials, thus, he was able to perform with the Manhattan Theater Club for free.Winkler's first appearance on Broadway was as \"John\" in 42 Seconds from Broadway, a play that opened and closed on March 11, 1973. He swore to himself that one day he would \"make that right.\" By 1973, he had roles in two independent films, The Lords of Flatbush and Crazy Joe. He also performed with the improv group, Off the Wall New York. He continued to feel anxiety, however, with the process of cold reading during auditions and depended upon compensation strategies.By 1973, his agent told him that it was time to leave New York and explore possibilities in California. Although Winkler was initially resistant, thinking he was not a good fit for Hollywood, his agent was persistent. Winkler ultimately decided that he had earned enough money through his work in commercials to try Hollywood for one month. He and his Lords of Flatbush co-star, Perry King, thus traveled to Los Angeles on September 18, 1973. After meeting with his agency's west coast branch, and spending five days going to auditions, Winkler was hired for a small part on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, appearing in Season 4, Episode 10, \"The Dinner Party\"."}, {"text": "=== 1973\u20131984: Happy Days and stardom ===During his second week in Los Angeles, Winkler auditioned for the part of Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli, better known as \"Fonzie\" or \"The Fonz\", on a new show called Happy Days. Although he was an unknown, and not the first choice for the role, he was asked to return after his first audition for a second one in costume. In costume, and with a different voice, Winkler said his six lines, threw his script in the air, and left the room. He was offered the role on his birthday, and accepted it based on his condition that the producers would show who the character was when he took his jacket off. Winkler appeared on the first episode of Happy Days in January 1974, and was with the series continuously until it ended in July 1984.\"The Fonz\" was initially written as a minor role and developed as the foil for the central protagonist of the series, Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard). Winkler made his own interpretation of the character during the first episode, choosing not to comb his hair, chew gum, or keep a box of cigarettes rolled in his sleeve like actors typically did with this type of character. Although he tried to explain this philosophy to the producers, he was told he had to follow the script and comb his hair. He thus stood at the mirror, motioned in a way that suggested \"Hey I don't have to because it's perfect,\" and in doing so, created the seminal moment which defined the character. ABC executives did not want to see Fonzie wearing leather, thinking it would imply that the character was a criminal. Thus, during the first season, Winkler wore two different windbreaker jackets, one of which was green. Marshall argued with the executives about the jacket, and eventually they made a compromise: Fonzie could wear the leather jacket, but only in scenes with his motorcycle. Marshall thus made certain that his motorcycle was written into every scene. In reality, Winkler did not know how to ride a motorcycle. As he almost crashed it the first time he tried, he subsequently never rode the motorcycle during the series.By the middle of the second season in December 1974, \"The Fonz\" began his transition as a breakout character when he was featured as the central protagonist in the episode, \"Guess Who's Coming to Christmas\". By the third season, he became the lead of the series, as the storylines shifted away from the original protagonist, Richie Cunningham, to \"The Fonz\". Winkler recalled in a 2018 interview that he directly addressed the issue with Ron Howard, who portrayed Cunningham. According to Winkler, Howard told him that although he \"was signed on as the star, you did nothing except be as good as you could be. It's good for the show, we're friends.\" In 2021, Howard reiterated these points by stating that Winkler had been \"sort of a big brother\" to him.In a 2018 interview with Winkler, journalist Michael Schneider suggests that it was at this point that the character \"became the biggest icon on television\" at that time. Winkler responded by stating that he \"went from somebody who had no sense of self\" to a situation that was \"scary.\" He has also admitted that while he shares some characteristics with \"The Fonz\" such as loyalty to friends and an undercurrent of anger that he drew from his struggles with school as a child, they were fundamentally different from one another.During his decade on Happy Days, Winkler also appeared in a variety of roles in film and on television. In film, he appeared in Heroes (1977) with Harrison Ford and Sally Field and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama. He later appeared in Carl Reiner's The One and Only (1978) and in Ron Howard's 1982 directorial debut, Night Shift with Shelley Long before she appeared in Cheers and a then-unknown Michael Keaton. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his work in Night Shift.In television, he served as executive producer and host for the 50-minute television version of the documentary, Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids? (1978), which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series or Special. He was also an executive producer for the ABC Afterschool Special: Run, Don't Walk (1981), based on the novel of the same name by Harriet May Savitz, and featuring his Happy Days co-star, Scott Baio. He further directed Baio in the 13th episode of the Happy Days spin-off, Joanie Loves Chachi, also starring Erin Moran.In addition, Winkler starred in An American Christmas Carol (1979), and served as a co-host for the Music for UNICEF Concert (1979). He also appeared as \"Fonzie\" on Sesame Street to promote the letter \"A\" (ayyyy), later recalling that it was \"the only time I ever appeared as the Fonz on something else. I had a strict rule about that, but they asked me and it was my pleasure.\""}, {"text": "=== Post Happy Days ===After Happy Days ended in 1984, Winkler was typecast, and could not get acting roles until 1991. He later stated that his \"agent would put me out there and people would say, 'You know, he's great, he's a wonderful guy, really good actor. Funny, So funny. But he was the Fonz.'\" Winkler, who desired to be a working actor, felt \"rudderless\" during this period; desiring to continue a presence in the industry, he started the production company Fair Dinkum Productions in the late 1970s. The name fair dinkum was taken from Australian English slang, meaning something is \"honest\" or \"authentic\". In 1987, he inked a new feature film and development pact with the studio.In 1984, Winkler directed, and was executive producer for, the CBS Schoolbreak Special: \"All the Kids Do It\" starring Scott Baio, which won the 1985 Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Children's Special and was nominated for the 1985 Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Directing in Children's Programming.

His role was uncredited, however, as the producers were concerned that he would only be seen as The Fonz, and thus distract from the film. After the screening, he received positive feedback for his role and was subsequently asked to participate in the publicity campaign for Scream.In 2000, Winkler was nominated for a Primetime Emmy, Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, for his portrayal of Dr. Henry Olson in three episodes of The Practice.

He directed Ritter in the 1986 television movie A Smoky Mountain Christmas starring Dolly Parton, and in 1993, they co-starred in the made-for-television movie, The Only Way Out.Later in 1999, Neil Simon gave Winkler the chance to be involved with his first theatrical production since 1973, when he asked him to do a read-through of The Dinner Party. Given the problems he had with cold-readings, Winkler initially panicked. However, he asked for the script in advance in order to memorize it, and managed to get through the reading. Simon eventually contacted Winkler again, and asked him to be in the theatrical version he was staging, to which Winkler agreed. He was also excited to be working with Ritter again. Although their initial debut was not well-received, they were invited to perform the play in Washington, D.C. with a few casting changes, and it received positive reviews. The play then moved to Broadway, and again received positive reviews.In September 2003, he was slated for a guest appearance on Ritter's show, 8 Simple Rules.

For his portrayal of Barry Zuckerkorn, Winkler won a Gold Derby Award: Comedy Guest Actor in 2004. In 2014, Winkler was nominated as part of the cast for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.Arrested Development is known for its \"inside jokes\". In three episodes of the 2013 reboot, Winkler's son Max portrayed \"young Barry Zuckerkorn\" in flashbacks.

Hein coined the phrase in 1985, in response to a 1977 Happy Days episode in which Fonzie jumps over a shark while on water-skis."}, {"text": "=== 2003\u20132019: Hank Zipzer ===Winkler's career as an author began with the Hank Zipzer series of children's books about the adventures of a dyslexic child, which he co-wrote with Lin Oliver. During the early 2000s, when Winkler experienced \"a lull in [his] acting career\", his manager Alan Berger suggested that he write children's books about the difficulties he experienced as a child before he knew that he was dyslexic. Winkler was resistant to the idea until Berger suggested that Winkler co-write the books with an experienced author.Berger introduced Winkler to Oliver, and the two met for lunch and created the character of Hank Zipzer. Winkler chose the name Hank from the nickname for Henry, and Zipzer from the name of a neighbor in the apartment building that he grew up in. Winkler and Oliver's writing process, which involved developing ideas during in-person discussions, drew upon their mutual background in television. According to Winkler, the system drew upon his strengths as an actor, allowing him to work through ideas out loud.The original series spanned seventeen books, published from 2003 to 2010. Following that, Winkler and Oliver wrote a prequel series, Here's Hank (2014 to 2019), which explores Hank's life as a second-grader before he was diagnosed as dyslexic. The Here's Hank series uses a dyslexic-friendly font called Dyslexie, marking the first time that this font was used in a book published in the United States.Winkler and Oliver also created the television adaptation Hank Zipzer, which ran for three seasons, from 2014 to 2016. The series appeared on the children's BBC Channel, as they could not find an American buyer for it. After the series was successful on the BBC, it was broadcast on the Universal Kids Channel in the United States.
